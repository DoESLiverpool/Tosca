# Getting Machinekit Running

This assumes you've already got a Beaglebone with Machinekit installed, but can be expanded as we get more detail on installing things.  It also assumes you have a computer running Linux to connect it to.

 1. Plug the Beaglebone into the laptop with a USB cable
 1. ssh -X machinekit@192.168.7.2
 1. Log in with the password machinekit
FIXME Need to check and complete this...
