## Tosca

Machinekit-powered polargraph drawing robot.

As part of the [Phrased & Confused](http://www.phrasedandconfused.co.uk/) at [Liverpool Acoustic Festival](http://www.phrasedandconfused.co.uk/events/phrased-confused-at-liverpool-acoustic-festival-3) we're aiming to have a polargraph perform alongside a poet.

## Reference Links

 * [Machinekit](http://www.machinekit.io/) - the operating system to control the CNC motors.

## Name

Named after the mother of Knut, the famous *polar* bear from Berlin Zoo.

## Updates

System now does not use machinekit and is now able to run PWM-H-bridge servos and quadrature decodes directly from the board.
