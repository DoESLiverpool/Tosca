   Red Card


   Right from the off,
   straight into your penalty area
   a quick one-two and it was all over
   bar the shouting. Easy
   Easy sang the terraces.

   Half-time : I’ve given you a hundred per cent
   and more. Two down, and I’ve got it all
   to do again.

   At the end of the day
   the lap of honour. Your ribbons
   round the Cup. I am
   sick as a parrot. I am
   over the moon you tell the cameras,
   the waiting millions.
   Back home I walk
   alone.
