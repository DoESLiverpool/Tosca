<h1 class="topofpageheads">Without  You </h1>
<p class="poembodytext"><br />
  Without you every morning would be like  going back to work after a holiday<br />
  Without you I couldn&rsquo;t stand the smell of  the East Lancs Road, <br />
  Without you ghost ferries would cross  the Mersey manned by skeleton crews, <br />
  Without you I&rsquo;d probably feel happy and  have more money and time and nothing to do with it, <br />
  Without you I&rsquo;d have to leave my  stillborn poems on other people&rsquo;s doorsteps, wrapped in brown paper, <br />
  Without you there&rsquo;d never be sauce to  put on sausage butties, <br />
  Without you plastic flowers in shop  windows would just be plastic flowers in shop windows, <br />
  Without you I&rsquo;d spend my summers picking  morosely over the remains of train crashes,<br />
  Without you white birds would wrench  themselves free from my paintings and fly off dripping blood into the night, <br />
  Without you green apples wouldn&rsquo;t taste  greener, <br />
  Without you Mothers wouldn&rsquo;t let their  children play out after tea, <br />
  Without you every musician in the world  would forget how to play the blues, <br />
  Without you Public Houses would be  public again, <br />
  Without you the Sunday Times colour  supplement would come out in black-and-white, <br />
  Without you indifferent colonels would  shrug their shoulders and press the button, <br />
  Without you they&rsquo;d stop changing the  flowers in Piccadilly   Gardens, <br />
  Without you Clark Kent would  forget how to become Superman, <br />
  Without you Sunshine Breakfast would  only consist of Cornflakes, <br />
  Without you there&rsquo;d be no colour in  Magic colouring books, <br />
  Without you Mahler&rsquo;s 8th would only be  performed by street musicians in derelict houses, <br />
  Without you they&rsquo;d forget to put the  salt in every packet of crisps, <br />
  Without you it would be an offence  punishable by a fine of up to £200 or two months&rsquo; imprisonment to be found in  possession of curry powder, <br />
  Without you riot police are massing in  quiet sidestreets, <br />
  Without you all streets would be one-way  the other way, <br />
  Without you there&rsquo;d be no one not to  kiss goodnight when we quarrel, <br />
  Without you the first martian to land  would turn round and go away again, <br />
  Without you they&rsquo;d forget to change the  weather, <br />
  Without you blind men would sell unlucky  heather, <br />
  Without you there would be<br />
  no landscapes/ no stations/ no houses, <br />
  no chipshops/ no quiet villages/ no  seagulls<br />
  on beaches/ no hopscotch on pavements/  no night/ no morning/ there&rsquo;d be no city no country<br />
Without you.</p>
