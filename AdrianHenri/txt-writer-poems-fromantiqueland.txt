   Cows browse
   in the Basilica
   black-and-white
   against black columns.

   Eyes blue
   in the basalt darkness
   glow like poppies.

   She waits patient at the gate
   for us, tattooed patterns
   on her face, weathered
   as the desert.

   who clings to her black skirts
   wears a Mickey Mouse T-shirt.

   A chameleon
   ignores the laws
   of Justinian
   on a granite wall.

   Quasr et Hallorat.


   7  Petra

   beyond the dreams of postmen,

   beyond the dreams of palettes,
   wait to be reborn
   beyond the dark passage.

   I smear my mouth with Vaseline
   my lips dry
   for lack of your kisses .

   10  Aphrodite

   She dances
   - tiny, golden,
   voluptuous -
   to unheard music
   in a museum case
   in Liverpool.
