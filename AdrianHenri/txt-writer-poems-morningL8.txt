    Morning, Liverpool 8



    In Blackburne Place and Canning Street
    the terraces half-wake,
    stretch their balconies;
    cast-iron railings, Ionic columns
    blink into daylight from
    a nightmare of bulldozers,
    dripping water, charred beams,
    distant dreams of hopscotch,
    hoofbeats on cobblestones. The mirror tells
    of a bright new face, does not reflect
    the past neglect. Hope Place
    and Huskisson tell of the nightmare
    almost gone.
