   1

   Striped nurses
   Slip silent into lighted tents
   Whisper words within
   Like clandestine lovers


   2.

   A Saxon burial-figure
   I lie in bed, knees to chest,
   but apart. Hands across heart
   Poulenc’s Piano Concerto l
   looping through my head.


   3.

   Where do they go to?
   Where not go gentle?
   Coughing, farting, retching,
   Shuffling, into below-flight-deck
   Neon light, airport air
   Tinged with the smell of the Mahonia
   From Chrostine’s garden.


   4.

   I want to be
   In a dark warm place with you,
   Where no-one can hear me say
   ‘I love you’. Where I would slip between
   Your breath, where we would float,
   Between the notes, beyond the Isle of Capri,
   Where pain melts away
   Into gentle day.
