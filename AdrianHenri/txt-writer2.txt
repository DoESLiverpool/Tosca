BEGIN NOW    Best Friends
BEGIN NOW    It’s Susan I talk to not Tracey,
BEGIN NOW    Before that I sat next to Jane;
BEGIN NOW    I used to be best friends with Lynda
BEGIN NOW    But these days I think she’s a pain.
BEGIN NOW    Natasha’s all right in small doses,
BEGIN NOW    I meet Mandy sometimes in town;
BEGIN NOW    I’m jealous of Annabel’s poney
BEGIN NOW    And I don’t like Nicola’s frown.
BEGIN NOW    I used to go skating with Catherine,
BEGIN NOW    Before that I went there with Ruth;
BEGIN NOW    And Kate’s so much better at trampoline:
BEGIN NOW    She’s a showoff to tell you the truth.
BEGIN NOW    I think that I’m going off Susan,
BEGIN NOW    She borrowed my comb yesterday;
BEGIN NOW    I think I might sit next to Tracey,
BEGIN NOW    She’s my nearly best friend: she’s OK.
BEGIN NOW    Claustrophobia
BEGIN NOW    Emily’s got claustrophobia
BEGIN NOW    She’s afraid of Santa Claus
BEGIN NOW    Christmas is different in her house
BEGIN NOW    It’s not like in mine or yours
BEGIN NOW    She’s terrified of men with beards
BEGIN NOW    And suits of brightest red
BEGIN NOW    Sneaking down the chimney
BEGIN NOW    While she’s fast asleep in bed
BEGIN NOW    She’s hidden away her stockings
BEGIN NOW    At the back of the chest of drawers
BEGIN NOW    She’s covered up the fireplace
BEGIN NOW    And locked the bedroom door
BEGIN NOW    A kiss from Father Christmas
BEGIN NOW    Is the thing she dreads the most
BEGIN NOW    She’d rather be hugged by Dracula
BEGIN NOW    Or Jacob Marley’s ghost
BEGIN NOW    She hates holly, robins and ivy
BEGIN NOW    She won’t go and play in the snow
BEGIN NOW    You’ll never catch her standing
BEGIN NOW    Beneath the mistletoe
BEGIN NOW    Emily’s got claustrophobia
BEGIN NOW    Carol singers make her feel queer
BEGIN NOW    Don’t wish her a Merry Christmas
BEGIN NOW    She’s hiding away till New Year.
BEGIN NOW    H 25
BEGIN NOW    Hedgehogs hog the hedges,
BEGIN NOW    roadhogs hog the roads:
BEGIN NOW    I’d like to build a motorway
BEGIN NOW    for badgers, frogs and toads,
BEGIN NOW    with halts for hungry hedgehogs
BEGIN NOW    at an all-night service station;
BEGIN NOW    four lanes wide and free from man
BEGIN NOW    right across the nation.
BEGIN NOW    Free from oil and petrol fumes,
BEGIN NOW    and free from motor cars,
BEGIN NOW    to see the busy hedgehogs trot
BEGIN NOW    underneath the stars.
BEGIN NOW    The Haunted Disco
BEGIN NOW    When it’s half past three in the morning
BEGIN NOW    right through to break of day,
BEGIN NOW    a phantom DJ opens up
BEGIN NOW    for the dead to come and play.
BEGIN NOW    The coloured lights are flashing,
BEGIN NOW    and the crowd are on their feet,
BEGIN NOW    but there’s no sound of them dancing
BEGIN NOW    to the ghostly disco-beat.
BEGIN NOW    When there’s ice between your shoulders,
BEGIN NOW    and the hairs rise on your neck,
BEGIN NOW    and you don’t know who you’re dancing with
BEGIN NOW    at the haunted discotheque.
BEGIN NOW    When you daren’t look at your partner,
BEGIN NOW    and you fear their bony hand,
BEGIN NOW    the go-go ghosts all boogie
BEGIN NOW    to an ancient, nameless band.
BEGIN NOW    The graveyard sounds are all around
BEGIN NOW    the mist drifts everywhere,
BEGIN NOW    but the ghastly crowds in mini-shrouds
BEGIN NOW    rave on without a care.
BEGIN NOW    When there’s ice between your shoulders,
BEGIN NOW    and the hairs rise on your neck,
BEGIN NOW    and you know you’ll dance for ever
BEGIN NOW    in the haunted discotheque.
BEGIN NOW    Librarian
BEGIN NOW    browsing through
BEGIN NOW    libraries
BEGIN NOW    of your imagined kisses
BEGIN NOW    lipreading.
BEGIN NOW    The Phantom Lollipop Lady
BEGIN NOW    The phantom lollipop lady
BEGIN NOW    haunts the crossroads
BEGIN NOW    where the old school used to be;
BEGIN NOW    they closed it down in 1973.
BEGIN NOW    The old lollipop lady
BEGIN NOW    loved her job, and stood there
BEGIN NOW    for seven years altogether,
BEGIN NOW    no matter how bad the weather.
BEGIN NOW    When they pulled the old school down
BEGIN NOW    she still stood there every day:
BEGIN NOW    a pocketful of sweets for the little ones,
BEGIN NOW    smiles and a joke for the big ones.
BEGIN NOW    One day the lollipop lady
BEGIN NOW    was taken away to hospital.
BEGIN NOW    Without her standing there
BEGIN NOW    the corner looked, somehow, bare.
BEGIN NOW    After a month and two operations
BEGIN NOW    the lollipop lady died;
BEGIN NOW    the children felt something missing:
BEGIN NOW    she had made her final crossing.
BEGIN NOW    Now if you go down alone at dusk
BEGIN NOW    just before the streetlights go on,
BEGIN NOW    look closely at the corner over there:
BEGIN NOW    in the shadows by the lamp-post you’ll see her.
BEGIN NOW    Helping phantom children across the street,
BEGIN NOW    holding up the traffic with a ghostly hand;
BEGIN NOW    at the twilight crossing where four roads meet
BEGIN NOW    the phantom lollipop lady stands.
BEGIN NOW       Noble Jones from Wallasey, the bravest cat in the world
BEGIN NOW       Noble Jones is noble
BEGIN NOW       Noble Jones is strong
BEGIN NOW       Noble Jones goes round the place
BEGIN NOW       Defending right from wrong
BEGIN NOW       A smile upon his noble face
BEGIN NOW       Embodiment of feline grace
BEGIN NOW       He’s the pride of Merseyside
BEGIN NOW       The bravest cat in the world.
BEGIN NOW    A gang of desperadoes
BEGIN NOW    Had terrorized the land
BEGIN NOW    There were ugly scenes in Milton Keynes
BEGIN NOW    Till Noble took a hand
BEGIN NOW    He hounded them in Hounslow
BEGIN NOW    And tied some up in Tring
BEGIN NOW    He caught the rest in Crawley
BEGIN NOW    They couldn’t do a thing
BEGIN NOW    Single-pawed he beat them
BEGIN NOW    At their evil game
BEGIN NOW    Locked them up in Wormwood Scrubs
BEGIN NOW    And wouldn’t leave his name.
BEGIN NOW       For Noble Jones is modest
BEGIN NOW       And Noble Jones is strong
BEGIN NOW       Villains quake and start to shake
BEGIN NOW       When Noble comes along.
BEGIN NOW    Relaxing at New Brighton
BEGIN NOW    Curled up on the beach
BEGIN NOW    He saw a kitten drowning
BEGIN NOW    Swept from her parent’s reach
BEGIN NOW    Swiftly to the rescue
BEGIN NOW    He sprang into the waves
BEGIN NOW    Avoiding by a whisker
BEGIN NOW    A hero’s watery grave
BEGIN NOW    Safely from the Mersey
BEGIN NOW    He set her on the shore
BEGIN NOW    But when the crowd turned round to cheer
BEGIN NOW    He’d disappeared once more.
BEGIN NOW       For Noble Jones is modest
BEGIN NOW       And Noble Jones is shy
BEGIN NOW       People cheer, forget their fear
BEGIN NOW       When Noble passes by.
BEGIN NOW    One day at Watford Junction
BEGIN NOW    The brakes refused to function
BEGIN NOW    And the Inter-City nearly left the track
BEGIN NOW    With no fear of broken bones
BEGIN NOW    Down jumped brave Noble Jones
BEGIN NOW    Dug in his claws and hauled the engine back.
BEGIN NOW       As big as a crocodile’s toothbrush
BEGIN NOW       As huge as a dinosaur’s bones
BEGIN NOW       As large as an elephant’s hanky
BEGIN NOW       Is the heart of Noble Jones.
BEGIN NOW       In Cardiff and Camarthen
BEGIN NOW       They sang his praise aloud
BEGIN NOW       From Penrith down to Plymouth
BEGIN NOW       The did our hero proud
BEGIN NOW    When The Queen conferred his Knighthood
BEGIN NOW    A banner was unfurled
BEGIN NOW    SIR NOBLE JONES FROM WALLASEY
BEGIN NOW    THE BRAVEST CAT IN THE WORLD.
BEGIN NOW       For Noble Jones is noble
BEGIN NOW       And Noble Jones is strong
BEGIN NOW       Noble Jones goes round the place
BEGIN NOW       Defending right from wrong
BEGIN NOW       A smile upon his noble face
BEGIN NOW       Embodiment of feline grace
BEGIN NOW       He’s the pride of Merseyside
BEGIN NOW       The bravest cat in the world.

BEGIN NOW    Pigeon, rat or vole
BEGIN NOW    Our new cat’s bionic
BEGIN NOW    His miaow can shatter glass
BEGIN NOW    He dug up next door’s gardent
BEGIN NOW    Then started on someone’s path
BEGIN NOW    The neighbours didn’t like him
BEGIN NOW    So they looked in the catalogue
BEGIN NOW    Clubbed together and ordered
BEGIN NOW    A bionic Superdog
BEGIN NOW    Now Rex is king of the Crescent
BEGIN NOW    Poor Tom won’t leave the house
BEGIN NOW    Won’t even play with his video game
BEGIN NOW    He’s afraid to touch the mouse
BEGIN NOW    Curled up next to his socket
BEGIN NOW    With a soft, electric purr
BEGIN NOW    Robocat’s a pussycat
BEGIN NOW    When Robodog is there.

BEGIN NOW    Some Other Guy
BEGIN NOW    ‘Trick or treat,’
BEGIN NOW    behind the mask
BEGIN NOW    I lurk in your street
BEGIN NOW    hoping for kisses.
BEGIN NOW    ‘A penny for the guy,’
BEGIN NOW    outside your gate
BEGIN NOW    I lie, disguised,
BEGIN NOW    wait for a smile.
BEGIN NOW    You warm your hands
BEGIN NOW    at someone else’s bonfire:
BEGIN NOW    rockets, Catherine-wheels explode
BEGIN NOW    in someone else’s garden.
BEGIN NOW    Song of the Earth
BEGIN NOW    Look deep into the hidden world of ponds.
BEGIN NOW    Mosses, tadpoles, the gently-moving fronds
BEGIN NOW    of water-crowfoot. Help clean up
BEGIN NOW    this tiny world. Curled tendrils of fern
BEGIN NOW    peer hopefully through bin-bags, chip-papers,
BEGIN NOW    choke on polystyrene. Green water
BEGIN NOW    fights for its breath amid the stink fo sewage,
BEGIN NOW    black rainbows of oil. Mersey and Alt,
BEGIN NOW    Dee and Weaver leave a cry for help
BEGIN NOW    with every tide. Our leavings mark
BEGIN NOW    their riverside.
BEGIN NOW    So bring in your wellies, bring in your macs,
BEGIN NOW    never mind sore feet or aching backs.
BEGIN NOW    Take a dawn walk on Hilbre. Wait
BEGIN NOW    in the silvery light to see the birds migrate.
BEGIN NOW    Clean up the Lowfields, clean up the beach,
BEGIN NOW    clear the canal and footpath, each of you
BEGIN NOW    can find a small thing to do
BEGIN NOW    to reciprocate. Give back the gifts
BEGIN NOW    of scabious and celandine, wood anemone
BEGIN NOW    and wild garlic, before it’s too late.
BEGIN NOW    So bring binoculars, notebook and pen,
BEGIN NOW    this land can be green and pleasant again.
BEGIN NOW    Families lark in the mud to trace the tiny creatures.
BEGIN NOW    A pond made safe for toad. Behind the motorways,
BEGIN NOW    the access-roads, the land shyly reveals its features.
BEGIN NOW    In Kirby a wood grows where one nearly died;
BEGIN NOW    look inside: see how new life starts
BEGIN NOW    beneath tyres and tin cans, boxes and shopping-carts.
BEGIN NOW    So bring your raincoats, bring your boots,
BEGIN NOW    dig in the earth and find your roots.
BEGIN NOW    Life is short but the earth is long
BEGIN NOW    put your ear to the ground and hear its song.
BEGIN NOW    Teacher’s Pet
BEGIN NOW    What sort of creature
BEGIN NOW    is a teacher’s pet?
BEGIN NOW    What sort of pet
BEGIN NOW    would a teacher get?
BEGIN NOW    Would it be a mongoose?
BEGIN NOW    Would it be a snake?
BEGIN NOW    Would it be a vampire
BEGIN NOW    with a thirst to slake?
BEGIN NOW    Would it be a bulldog
BEGIN NOW    or a Pekinese?
BEGIN NOW    Would it be a cuddly kitten
BEGIN NOW    or a tomcat full of fleas?
BEGIN NOW    Would it be a blue-eye?
BEGIN NOW    Would it be a swot?
BEGIN NOW    What sort of pet
BEGIN NOW    has your teacher got?
BEGIN NOW    The Dark
BEGIN NOW    I don’t like the dark coming down on my head
BEGIN NOW    It feels like a blanket thrown over the bed
BEGIN NOW    I don’t like the dark coming down on my head
BEGIN NOW    I don’t like the dark coming down over me
BEGIN NOW    It feels like the room’s full of things I can’t see
BEGIN NOW    I don’t like the dark coming down over me
BEGIN NOW    There isn’t enough light from under the door
BEGIN NOW    It only just reaches the edge of the floor
BEGIN NOW    There isn’t enough light from under the door
BEGIN NOW    I wish that my dad hadn’t put out the light
BEGIN NOW    It feels like there’s something that’s just out of sight
BEGIN NOW    I wish that my dad hadn’t put out the light
BEGIN NOW    But under the bedclothes it’s warm and secure
BEGIN NOW    You can’t see the ceiling you can’t see the floor
BEGIN NOW    Yes, under the bedclothes it’s warm and secure
BEGIN NOW    So I think I’ll stay here till it’s daylight once more.

BEGIN NOW    Dear Janine,
BEGIN NOW    A postcard from the edge
BEGIN NOW    of Africa. Impressions d'Afrique.
BEGIN NOW    Only a week, and already memories
BEGIN NOW    come and go, regular as the ferry,
BEGIN NOW    regular as thoughts of her, despite
BEGIN NOW    the catwalk grace of girls on the beach,
BEGIN NOW    each with an invisible load on her head;
BEGIN NOW    skin so black that it refracts the light,
BEGIN NOW    as evening sprawls across the harbour,
BEGIN NOW    staining dark red walls a darker red.
BEGIN NOW    I sit on the terrace for hours. The fish
BEGIN NOW    is delicious. Can't wait to paint
BEGIN NOW    the flowers. I want to stay.
BEGIN NOW    love,
BEGIN NOW    A.

BEGIN NOW    Tonight at noon.
BEGIN NOW   Winter Garden
BEGIN NOW There is a garden in her face
BEGIN NOW Where roses and white lilies grow
BEGIN NOW    The bathwater smelling of blackberries,
BEGIN NOW    my hair of white nettles, my body
BEGIN NOW    soaped with the scent of green ferns.
BEGIN NOW    We walked in the Botanical Gardens
BEGIN NOW    in winter. Small pink flowers
BEGIN NOW    against the gloom. Berries bloomed,
BEGIN NOW    cherry ripe. You rang, this morning.
BEGIN NOW    There is a garden in this place,
BEGIN NOW    of sorts. A lone honeysuckle
BEGIN NOW    huddles against the frost, that rimes
BEGIN NOW    the unchecked weeds of summer,
BEGIN NOW    brown stalks of lily-of-the-valley.
BEGIN NOW    O ruddier than the cherry,
BEGIN NOW    O brighter than the berry
BEGIN NOW    Tonight I meet you from the plane.
BEGIN NOW    All I can offer, once again,
BEGIN NOW    a winter garden,
BEGIN NOW    the smell of blackberries, green ferns,
BEGIN NOW    white nettles.
BEGIN NOW                                   Without You
BEGIN NOW    Without you every morning would be like going back to work after a
BEGIN NOW    holiday
BEGIN NOW    Without you I couldn’t stand the smell of the East Lancs Road,
BEGIN NOW    Without you ghost ferries would cross the Mersey manned by skeleton
BEGIN NOW    crews,
BEGIN NOW    Without you I’d probably feel happy and have more money and time and
BEGIN NOW    nothing to do with it,
BEGIN NOW    Without you I’d have to leave my stillborn poems on other people’s
BEGIN NOW    doorsteps, wrapped in brown paper,
BEGIN NOW    Without you there’d never be sauce to put on sausage butties,
BEGIN NOW    Without you plastic flowers in shop windows would just be plastic
BEGIN NOW    flowers in shop windows,
BEGIN NOW    Without you I’d spend my summers picking morosely over the remains of
BEGIN NOW    train crashes,
BEGIN NOW    Without you white birds would wrench themselves free from my paintings
BEGIN NOW    and fly off dripping blood into the night,
BEGIN NOW    Without you green apples wouldn’t taste greener,
BEGIN NOW    Without you Mothers wouldn’t let their children play out after tea,
BEGIN NOW    Without you every musician in the world would forget how to play the
BEGIN NOW    blues,
BEGIN NOW    Without you Public Houses would be public again,
BEGIN NOW    Without you the Sunday Times colour supplement would come out in
BEGIN NOW    black-and-white,
BEGIN NOW    Without you indifferent colonels would shrug their shoulders and press
BEGIN NOW    the button,
BEGIN NOW    Without you they’d stop changing the flowers in Piccadilly Gardens,
BEGIN NOW    Without you Clark Kent would forget how to become Superman,
BEGIN NOW    Without you Sunshine Breakfast would only consist of Cornflakes,
BEGIN NOW    Without you there’d be no colour in Magic colouring books,
BEGIN NOW    Without you Mahler’s 8th would only be performed by street musicians in
BEGIN NOW    derelict houses,
BEGIN NOW    Without you they’d forget to put the salt in every packet of crisps,
BEGIN NOW    Without you it would be an offence punishable by a fine of up to £200
BEGIN NOW    or two months’ imprisonment to be found in possession of curry powder,
BEGIN NOW    Without you riot police are massing in quiet sidestreets,
BEGIN NOW    Without you all streets would be one-way the other way,
BEGIN NOW    Without you there’d be no one not to kiss goodnight when we quarrel,
BEGIN NOW    Without you the first martian to land would turn round and go away
BEGIN NOW    again,
BEGIN NOW    Without you they’d forget to change the weather,
BEGIN NOW    Without you blind men would sell unlucky heather,
BEGIN NOW    Without you there would be
BEGIN NOW    no landscapes/ no stations/ no houses,
BEGIN NOW    no chipshops/ no quiet villages/ no seagulls
BEGIN NOW    on beaches/ no hopscotch on pavements/ no night/ no morning/ there’d be
BEGIN NOW    no city no country
BEGIN NOW    Without you.

BEGIN NOW    2.
BEGIN NOW    A Saxon burial-figure
BEGIN NOW    I lie in bed, knees to chest,
BEGIN NOW    but apart. Hands across heart
BEGIN NOW    Poulenc’s Piano Concerto l
BEGIN NOW    looping through my head.
BEGIN NOW    3.
BEGIN NOW    Where do they go to?
BEGIN NOW    Where not go gentle?
BEGIN NOW    Coughing, farting, retching,
BEGIN NOW    Shuffling, into below-flight-deck
BEGIN NOW    Neon light, airport air
BEGIN NOW    Tinged with the smell of the Mahonia
BEGIN NOW    From Chrostine’s garden.
BEGIN NOW    4.
BEGIN NOW    I want to be
BEGIN NOW    In a dark warm place with you,
BEGIN NOW    Where no-one can hear me say
BEGIN NOW    ‘I love you’. Where I would slip between
BEGIN NOW    Your breath, where we would float,
BEGIN NOW    Between the notes, beyond the Isle of Capri,
BEGIN NOW    Where pain melts away
BEGIN NOW    Into gentle day.
BEGIN NOW                                        Me

BEGIN NOW     Morning, Liverpool 8
BEGIN NOW     In Blackburne Place and Canning Street
BEGIN NOW     the terraces half-wake,
BEGIN NOW     stretch their balconies;
BEGIN NOW     cast-iron railings, Ionic columns
BEGIN NOW     blink into daylight from
BEGIN NOW     a nightmare of bulldozers,
BEGIN NOW     dripping water, charred beams,
BEGIN NOW     distant dreams of hopscotch,
BEGIN NOW     hoofbeats on cobblestones. The mirror tells
BEGIN NOW     of a bright new face, does not reflect
BEGIN NOW     the past neglect. Hope Place
BEGIN NOW     and Huskisson tell of the nightmare
BEGIN NOW     almost gone.
BEGIN NOW    Morning, Sunset Heights
BEGIN NOW    Dogs bark
BEGIN NOW    down the canyon.
BEGIN NOW    A crow croaks
BEGIN NOW    its complimentary
BEGIN NOW    wake-u-up
BEGIN NOW    croak-o-gram;
BEGIN NOW    a hummingbird sips
BEGIN NOW    from the hibiscus.
BEGIN NOW    Bougainvillea
BEGIN NOW    glows. The sun
BEGIN NOW    hides behind thin mist
BEGIN NOW    'Have a nice day'
BEGIN NOW    ready on his lips.
BEGIN NOW    New York City Blues
BEGIN NOW    (for John Lennon)
BEGIN NOW    You do not cross the road
BEGIN NOW    To step into immortality
BEGIN NOW    An empty street is only the beginning
BEGIN NOW    The words will still flow through you
BEGIN NOW    Even on this cold pavement,
BEGIN NOW    Are heard in some far place
BEGIN NOW    Remote from flowers or flash-bulbs.
BEGIN NOW    In that city, on Gothic railings
BEGIN NOW    Dark against the snowy park
BEGIN NOW    Still a dead flower, a faded letter,
BEGIN NOW    Already one month old.
BEGIN NOW    "Life is what happens to you
BEGIN NOW    When you're busy making other plans,"
BEGIN NOW    This empty street
BEGIN NOW    Is only the beginning.
BEGIN NOW    Here, in your other city,
BEGIN NOW    Riot vans prowl the December dark,
BEGIN NOW    Remember angry embers of summer,
BEGIN NOW    Familiar ghost guitars echo from stucco terraces.
BEGIN NOW    Meanwhile, in the Valley of Indecision,
BEGIN NOW    We rehearse stale words, store up expected songs,
BEGIN NOW    Celebrate sad anniversaries.
BEGIN NOW    Flowers and flash-bulbs. Cold pavements.
BEGIN NOW    You do not cross the road
BEGIN NOW    To step into immortality
BEGIN NOW    At the dark end of the street
BEGIN NOW    Waits the inevitable stranger.
BEGIN NOW    Piccadilly Poem
BEGIN NOW    1
BEGIN NOW    Piccadilly
BEGIN NOW    Vast overflowing abundances of poemness
BEGIN NOW    LEWIS'S
BEGIN NOW    ... THE NATIONAL BANK
BEGIN NOW    A bus 83a O God in my mind screaming
BEGIN NOW    dragged beneath the wheels
BEGIN NOW    Horatory
BEGIN NOW    Minatory
BEGIN NOW    Messianic
BEGIN NOW    the ghost of Guillaume Apollinaire
BEGIN NOW    watches from glass and concrete perspectives of bus stations.
BEGIN NOW    2
BEGIN NOW    DAFFODILS ARE NOT REAL!
BEGIN NOW    3
BEGIN NOW    Sitting in a city square in the April sunshine
BEGIN NOW    I see the first beachheads of the Martian invasion
BEGIN NOW    Lapping over the rusticated walls.
BEGIN NOW    4
BEGIN NOW    7 cowboys stride into the city
BEGIN NOW    Hitch their horses to a bus terminal
BEGIN NOW    Sun on their shirts sweat on their faces sust caking their jeans
BEGIN NOW    Gun resting easily on hip.
BEGIN NOW    5
BEGIN NOW    NIGHT the time of the terrible neon wheel.
BEGIN NOW    6
BEGIN NOW    The smell of grass being mowed in the square;
BEGIN NOW    I sit in a café in Piccadilly
BEGIN NOW    And think of Yves Tanguy
BEGIN NOW    Alone in the crowded dugout eating sandwiches full of spiders.
BEGIN NOW    Poem for Roger McGough
BEGIN NOW    A nun in a Supermarket
BEGIN NOW    Standing in the queue
BEGIN NOW    Wondering what it's like
BEGIN NOW    To buy groceries for two.
BEGIN NOW    Salad Poem
BEGIN NOW    (for Henri Rousseau le Douanier)
BEGIN NOW    The sun is shining outside
BEGIN NOW    Henri Rousseau (Gentil Rousseau)
BEGIN NOW    The sky is blue
BEGIN NOW    like your skies
BEGIN NOW    I want to paint the salad
BEGIN NOW    on the table
BEGIN NOW    bright crisp green red purple
BEGIN NOW    lettuce and radishes, ham and tomatoes
BEGIN NOW    Paint them like your jungles
BEGIN NOW    Gentle Rousseau
BEGIN NOW    I want to paint
BEGIN NOW    All things bright and beautiful
BEGIN NOW    All salads great and small
BEGIN NOW    I want to make
BEGIN NOW    Blue skies bluer
BEGIN NOW    Green grass greener
BEGIN NOW    Pink flowers brighter
BEGIN NOW    Like you
BEGIN NOW    Henri Rousseau.
BEGIN NOW    Souvenirs
BEGIN NOW    (for John and Anne Willett)
BEGIN NOW    Chocolate sardines, torn election-posters MAR
BEGIN NOW    CHAIS, huddled sheep before a distant sepia
BEGIN NOW    view of Pourville. The yellow-and-grey world
BEGIN NOW    of Lords and Ladies on the wallpaper in
BEGIN NOW    the lingerie. Lemon light. Night hydrangeas.
BEGIN NOW    The smell of the ferry, scrubbed mussels
BEGIN NOW    deep blue in a white bowl in the electric kitchen,
BEGIN NOW    where moths beat against the windowpane. Blinding
BEGIN NOW    rain that wipes away the cliffs at Etretat.
BEGIN NOW    Green depths of evening sous-bois, tall trees
BEGIN NOW    that shutter the light along the banks outside
BEGIN NOW    the villages. A black workman's suit, a sailor's cap
BEGIN NOW    bought beside St Jacques. Oeufs de Pâques.
BEGIN NOW    Andouillettes, and mackerel cooked with driftwood
BEGIN NOW    on the beach. Each stone that I've brought home
BEGIN NOW    since 1968. Late light across the harvestfields
BEGIN NOW    from Ambrumesnil. Cattle dream, creamy as caramel.
BEGIN NOW    The smell across the valley from the Nescafé factory.
BEGIN NOW    The tall gingko tree that split ten years ago,
BEGIN NOW    one twin trunk that still lies overgrown,
BEGIN NOW    immutable as memory.
BEGIN NOW                            Summer Poems Without Words
BEGIN NOW    (To be distributed in leaflet form to the audience. Each poem should be
BEGIN NOW    tried within the next seven days)
BEGIN NOW    1          Try to imagine your next hangover
BEGIN NOW    2          Travel on the Woodside ferry with your eyes closed. Travel
BEGIN NOW    back with them open.
BEGIN NOW    3          Look for a black cat. Stoke it. This will be either lucky or
BEGIN NOW    unlucky.
BEGIN NOW    4          Find a plastic flower. Hold it up to the light.
BEGIN NOW    5          Next time you see someone mowing a lawn smell the smell of
BEGIN NOW    freshly cut grass.
BEGIN NOW    6          Watch Coronation Street. Listen to the ‘B’’ side of the
BEGIN NOW    latest Dusty Springfield record.
BEGIN NOW    7          Sit in a city square in the sunlight. Remember the first
BEGIN NOW    time you made love.
BEGIN NOW    8          Look at every poster you pass next time you’re on a bus.
BEGIN NOW    9          The next time you clean your teeth think about what you’re
BEGIN NOW    doing.
BEGIN NOW                                     The Bell
BEGIN NOW                                     The bell
BEGIN NOW                               tolled all afternoon
BEGIN NOW                              we did not send to ask
BEGIN NOW                                    for whom.
BEGIN NOW                                It told of flowers
BEGIN NOW                              heaped in a goalmouth,
BEGIN NOW                               red and blue scarves
BEGIN NOW                           heaped together at an altar;
BEGIN NOW                                    it told of
BEGIN NOW                              eyes like T.V. screens
BEGIN NOW                         haunted by last night's images,
BEGIN NOW                          tears dried by the April wind.
BEGIN NOW                            As the flags at half-mast
BEGIN NOW                                 stirred overhead
BEGIN NOW                                  the deep bell
BEGIN NOW                            still tolled in our heads
BEGIN NOW                          long after the light had gone.
BEGIN NOW    The Parsonage, Haworth
BEGIN NOW    In the earth, the earth thou shalt be laid,
BEGIN NOW    A grey stone standing over thee;
BEGIN NOW    Black mould beneath thee spread,
BEGIN NOW    And black mould to cover thee.
BEGIN NOW    Emily Brontë
BEGIN NOW    Gravestones piled deep as fallen leaves,
BEGIN NOW    trodden into the sodden ground;
BEGIN NOW    last consumptive flush of Autumn
BEGIN NOW    in the sycamores;
BEGIN NOW    a kissing-gate swings disused
BEGIN NOW    in the bitter wind.
BEGIN NOW    Cries of crows, rattle of rain,
BEGIN NOW    on the nursery windowpane;
BEGIN NOW    insistent tick of the grandfather clock,
BEGIN NOW    insistent tock of the stonemason's hammer,
BEGIN NOW    stammered epitaphs
BEGIN NOW    swathed in lichened green.
BEGIN NOW    It is not the stone that eats their bodies,
BEGIN NOW    but the black spring that runs through them
BEGIN NOW    that feeds the dark sarcophagus.
BEGIN NOW    A glimpse of sun
BEGIN NOW    sudden as a blush suffusing soft cheeks;
BEGIN NOW    pale blue eyes
BEGIN NOW    calling through blonde coppices of hair
BEGIN NOW    across the dimpled moors.
BEGIN NOW    The White Ball
BEGIN NOW    (after Ivan Puni: 'Construction With White Ball', 1915)
BEGIN NOW    'What is this?'
BEGIN NOW    the eager museum lady asks;
BEGIN NOW    'A Ball!' 'A Ball!'
BEGIN NOW    chorus the children.
BEGIN NOW    She tosses them words –
BEGIN NOW    'synthesis', 'construction', 'colour' –
BEGIN NOW    they wait in vain
BEGIN NOW    to catch a white ball.
BEGIN NOW    Adrian Henri's Talking Toxteth Blues
BEGIN NOW    Well, I woke up this morning, there was buzzing overhead
BEGIN NOW    Saw the helicopter as I got out of my bed,
BEGIN NOW    Smelt the smell of burning, saw the buildings fall,
BEGIN NOW    Bulldozers pulling down next door's wall.
BEGIN NOW    Toxteth nightmare …
BEGIN NOW    … yes …
BEGIN NOW    … city with a hangover.
BEGIN NOW    Then I remembered what happened last night
BEGIN NOW    The sirens and the shouting and the TV lights,
BEGIN NOW    Banging on the riotshields, petrol bombs in flames,
BEGIN NOW    Cars all ablazing, shattered window-frames.
BEGIN NOW    Felt sick to my stomach …
BEGIN NOW    … don't cry for me …
BEGIN NOW    … Upper Parly.
BEGIN NOW    Saw a busy lying blood pouring from his head,
BEGIN NOW    Saw one stop a paving stone, thought that he was dead.
BEGIN NOW    Heard the sound of engines in the bright orange night,
BEGIN NOW    Saw the headlights blazing, saw the crowd in flight.
BEGIN NOW    One of them …
BEGIN NOW    … didn't run fast enough …
BEGIN NOW    … Land Rovers …
BEGIN NOW    … long way from the farm.
BEGIN NOW    Well, I saw the Chief Constable up on TV
BEGIN NOW    And the Superintendents, but they never saw me,
BEGIN NOW    Saw the Home Secretary and the Minister for Riots,
BEGIN NOW    And all them social workers who just never keep quiet.
BEGIN NOW    … never met a one of them …
BEGIN NOW    … neither did the coppers.
BEGIN NOW    Saw a woman walking in the firelight's glare,
BEGIN NOW    "Hey, Aunty Maggy, what you doing there?"
BEGIN NOW    Arms full of liquor and a portable TV,
BEGIN NOW    Said, "All the rest are doing it, why not me?
BEGIN NOW    … do yourself a favour, son,
BEGIN NOW    … nice music centre …
BEGIN NOW    … over there.’’
BEGIN NOW    Well, I thought a bit about it and I took her advice
BEGIN NOW    Crowd was having fun and the goods looked nice,
BEGIN NOW    Then a scuffer copped me and they threw me in a van,
BEGIN NOW    Took me off to Risley and the Magistrate Man.
BEGIN NOW    … exemplary sentence …
BEGIN NOW    … act as a deterrent …
BEGIN NOW    … law 'n' order …
BEGIN NOW    … Toxteth nightmare ….
BEGIN NOW    … city …
BEGIN NOW    … with a
BEGIN NOW    hangover.
BEGIN NOW                              We Won’t Forget That
BEGIN NOW    we won't forget that
BEGIN NOW    that we laughed, laughed that
BEGIN NOW    much I'll never forget that
BEGIN NOW    that we laughed that much, will we?
BEGIN NOW    and we'll never forget be-
BEGIN NOW    cause we laughed that much and
BEGIN NOW    won't forget my God how much we laughed
BEGIN NOW    and not and never forget that we laughed so
BEGIN NOW    much because we were together
BEGIN NOW    and laughed so much
BEGIN NOW    we'll never forget that
BEGIN NOW    What Were You Thinking About ?
BEGIN NOW    Dressed and then dressed again
BEGIN NOW    what were you thinking about
BEGIN NOW    undressed
BEGIN NOW    I left my mink in the hallway
BEGIN NOW    and we went into the desert
BEGIN NOW    We lived on love and cold water
BEGIN NOW    we loved each other in our poverty
BEGIN NOW    we even ate our dirty linen in public
BEGIN NOW    and on the black sand tablecloth
BEGIN NOW    the sunlight spread its golden dishes
BEGIN NOW    We loved each other in our poverty
BEGIN NOW    we lived on love and cold water
BEGIN NOW    my body your freehold property.
