   Piccadilly Poem

   1
   Piccadilly
   Vast overflowing abundances of poemness
   LEWIS'S
   ... THE NATIONAL BANK
   A bus 83a O God in my mind screaming
   dragged beneath the wheels
   Horatory
   Minatory
   Messianic
   the ghost of Guillaume Apollinaire
   watches from glass and concrete perspectives of bus stations.

   DAFFODILS ARE NOT REAL!

   3
   Sitting in a city square in the April sunshine
   I see the first beachheads of the Martian invasion
   Lapping over the rusticated walls.

   4
   7 cowboys stride into the city
   Hitch their horses to a bus terminal
   Sun on their shirts sweat on their faces sust caking their jeans
   Gun resting easily on hip.

   5
   NIGHT the time of the terrible neon wheel.

   6
   The smell of grass being mowed in the square;
   I sit in a caf√© in Piccadilly
   And think of Yves Tanguy
   Alone in the crowded dugout eating sandwiches full of spiders.
