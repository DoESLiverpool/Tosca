<p class="poembodytext">When  Allen Ginsberg visited Liverpool, Adrian Henri  and Arthur Ballard took him to Everton, where Ginsberg spotted a sign saying &ldquo;Albion Street&rdquo;. He  of course read this as a momentous sign that William Blake was reaching out to  him. Henri wrote this homage to Ginsberg, Blake and to the girls of Liverpool,  while, typically, at the same time making a reference to the pop music, with an  allusion to Herman&rsquo;s Hermits &lsquo; hit, &lsquo;Mrs Brown, You&rsquo;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&rsquo;.<br />
  C.Marcangeli, <em>Poetry and Pop Music</em>, Tate Gallery Liverpool, 2007.</p>

  <span class="poembodytext"><em>(for Allen Ginsberg)</em></span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poembodytext">Albion&rsquo;s  most lovely daughter sat on the banks of the Mersey<br />
  dangling her landing stage in the water.</p>
<p class="poembodytext">The  daughters of Albion<br />
  arriving by underground at Central Station<br />
  eating hot ecclescakes at the Pierhead<br />
  writing «&nbsp;Billy Blake is Fab&nbsp;» on  a wall in Mathew Street</p>
<p class="poembodytext"> taking off their navyblue schooldrawers and <br />
  putting on nylon panties ready for the  night</p>
<p class="poembodytext">The  daughters of Albion<br />
  see the moonlight beating down on them in  Bebington<br />
  throw away their chewinggum ready for the  goodnight kiss<br />
  sleep  in the dinnertime sunlight with old men<br />
  looking up their skirts in St Johns Gardens<br />
  comb  their darkblonde hair in suburban bedrooms<br />
  powder  their delicate little nipples/wondering if tonight will <br />
  be the night<br />
  their  bodies pressed into dresses or sweaters<br />
  lavender  at The Cavern or pink at The Sink</p>
<p class="poembodytext">The  daughters of Albion wondering how to explain  why they <br />
  didn&rsquo;t  go home</p>
<p class="poembodytext">The  daughters of Albion<br />
  taking the dawn ferry to tomorrow<br />
  worrying about what happened<br />
  worrying about what hasn&rsquo;t happened<br />
  lacing up blue sneakers over brown ankles<br />
  fastening up brown stockings to blue  suspenderbelts</p>
<p class="poembodytext"><em> Beautiful boys with bright red guitars </em><br />
  <em> in the spaces between the stars </em> </p>
<p class="poembodytext">Reelin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-rockin&rsquo;<br />
  Wishin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-hopin&rsquo;<br />
  Kissin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-prayin&rsquo;<br />
  Lovin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-layin&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poembodytext">Mrs  Albion, you&rsquo;ve got a lovely daughter. </p>
