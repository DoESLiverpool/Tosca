   The Dark


   I don’t like the dark coming down on my head
   It feels like a blanket thrown over the bed
   I don’t like the dark coming down on my head

   I don’t like the dark coming down over me
   It feels like the room’s full of things I can’t see
   I don’t like the dark coming down over me

   There isn’t enough light from under the door
   It only just reaches the edge of the floor
   There isn’t enough light from under the door

   I wish that my dad hadn’t put out the light
   It feels like there’s something that’s just out of sight
   I wish that my dad hadn’t put out the light

   But under the bedclothes it’s warm and secure
   You can’t see the ceiling you can’t see the floor
   Yes, under the bedclothes it’s warm and secure
   So I think I’ll stay here till it’s daylight once more.
