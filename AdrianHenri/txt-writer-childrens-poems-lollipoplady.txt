   The Phantom Lollipop Lady


   The phantom lollipop lady
   haunts the crossroads
   where the old school used to be;
   they closed it down in 1973.

   The old lollipop lady
   loved her job, and stood there
   for seven years altogether,
   no matter how bad the weather.

   When they pulled the old school down
   she still stood there every day:
   a pocketful of sweets for the little ones,
   smiles and a joke for the big ones.

   One day the lollipop lady
   was taken away to hospital.
   Without her standing there
   the corner looked, somehow, bare.

   After a month and two operations
   the lollipop lady died;
   the children felt something missing:
   she had made her final crossing.

   Now if you go down alone at dusk
   just before the streetlights go on,
   look closely at the corner over there:
   in the shadows by the lamp-post youâ€™ll see her.

   Helping phantom children across the street,
   holding up the traffic with a ghostly hand;
   at the twilight crossing where four roads meet
   the phantom lollipop lady stands.
