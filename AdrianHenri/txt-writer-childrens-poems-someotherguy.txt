   Some Other Guy


   ‘Trick or treat,’
   behind the mask
   I lurk in your street
   hoping for kisses.

   ‘A penny for the guy,’
   outside your gate
   I lie, disguised,
   wait for a smile.

   You warm your hands
   at someone else’s bonfire:
   rockets, Catherine-wheels explode
   in someone else’s garden.
