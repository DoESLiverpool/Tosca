  <span class="poembodytext"><em>(for Charles  Mingus and the Clayton Squares)</em></span></p>
<p class="topofpageheads"><br />
  <span class="poembodytext">Tonight at noon<br />
  Supermarkets will advertise 3d EXTRA on  everything<br />
  Tonight at noon<br />
  Children from happy families will be  sent to live in a home<br />
  Elephants will tell each other human  jokes<br />
  America will declare peace on Russia<br />
  World War I generals will sell poppies  in the streets on November 11th<br />
  The first daffodils of autumn will  appear<br />
When the leaves fall upwards to the  trees</span></p>
<p class="poembodytext">Tonight at noon<br />
  Pigeons will hunt cats through city  backyards<br />
  Hitler will tell us to fight on the  beaches and on the landing fields<br />
  A tunnel full of water will be built  under Liverpool<br />
  Pigs will be sighted flying in formation  over Woolton<br />
  and Nelson will not only get his eye  back but his arm as well<br />
  White Americans will demonstrate for  equal rights<br />
  in front of the Black House<br />
And the Monster has just created Dr  Frankenstein</p>
<p class="poembodytext">Girls in bikinis are moonbathing<br />
  Folksongs are being sung by real folk<br />
  Art galleries are closed to people over  21<br />
  Poets get their poems in the Top 20<br />
  Politicians are elected to insane  asylums<br />
  There&rsquo;s jobs for everyone and nobody  wants them<br />
  In back alleys everywhere teenage lovers  are kissing<br />
  in broad daylight</p>
<p class="poembodytext">In forgotten graveyards the dead will  quietly bury the living<br />
  and <br />
  You will tell me you love me<br />
  Tonight at noon.</p>
