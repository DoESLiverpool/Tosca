   Best Friends


   It’s Susan I talk to not Tracey,
   Before that I sat next to Jane;
   I used to be best friends with Lynda
   But these days I think she’s a pain.

   Natasha’s all right in small doses,
   I meet Mandy sometimes in town;
   I’m jealous of Annabel’s poney
   And I don’t like Nicola’s frown.

   I used to go skating with Catherine,
   Before that I went there with Ruth;
   And Kate’s so much better at trampoline:
   She’s a showoff to tell you the truth.

   I think that I’m going off Susan,
   She borrowed my comb yesterday;
   I think I might sit next to Tracey,
   She’s my nearly best friend: she’s OK.
