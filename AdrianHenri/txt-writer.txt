   Best Friends
   It’s Susan I talk to not Tracey,
   Before that I sat next to Jane;
   I used to be best friends with Lynda
   But these days I think she’s a pain.
   Natasha’s all right in small doses,
   I meet Mandy sometimes in town;
   I’m jealous of Annabel’s poney
   And I don’t like Nicola’s frown.
   I used to go skating with Catherine,
   Before that I went there with Ruth;
   And Kate’s so much better at trampoline:
   She’s a showoff to tell you the truth.
   I think that I’m going off Susan,
   She borrowed my comb yesterday;
   I think I might sit next to Tracey,
   She’s my nearly best friend: she’s OK.
   Claustrophobia
   Emily’s got claustrophobia
   She’s afraid of Santa Claus
   Christmas is different in her house
   It’s not like in mine or yours
   She’s terrified of men with beards
   And suits of brightest red
   Sneaking down the chimney
   While she’s fast asleep in bed
   She’s hidden away her stockings
   At the back of the chest of drawers
   She’s covered up the fireplace
   And locked the bedroom door
   A kiss from Father Christmas
   Is the thing she dreads the most
   She’d rather be hugged by Dracula
   Or Jacob Marley’s ghost
   She hates holly, robins and ivy
   She won’t go and play in the snow
   You’ll never catch her standing
   Beneath the mistletoe
   Emily’s got claustrophobia
   Carol singers make her feel queer
   Don’t wish her a Merry Christmas
   She’s hiding away till New Year.
   H 25
   Hedgehogs hog the hedges,
   roadhogs hog the roads:
   I’d like to build a motorway
   for badgers, frogs and toads,
   with halts for hungry hedgehogs
   at an all-night service station;
   four lanes wide and free from man
   right across the nation.
   Free from oil and petrol fumes,
   and free from motor cars,
   to see the busy hedgehogs trot
   underneath the stars.
   The Haunted Disco
   When it’s half past three in the morning
   right through to break of day,
   a phantom DJ opens up
   for the dead to come and play.
   The coloured lights are flashing,
   and the crowd are on their feet,
   but there’s no sound of them dancing
   to the ghostly disco-beat.
   When there’s ice between your shoulders,
   and the hairs rise on your neck,
   and you don’t know who you’re dancing with
   at the haunted discotheque.
   When you daren’t look at your partner,
   and you fear their bony hand,
   the go-go ghosts all boogie
   to an ancient, nameless band.
   The graveyard sounds are all around
   the mist drifts everywhere,
   but the ghastly crowds in mini-shrouds
   rave on without a care.
   When there’s ice between your shoulders,
   and the hairs rise on your neck,
   and you know you’ll dance for ever
   in the haunted discotheque.

   The Phantom Lollipop Lady
   The phantom lollipop lady
   haunts the crossroads
   where the old school used to be;
   they closed it down in 1973.
   The old lollipop lady
   loved her job, and stood there
   for seven years altogether,
   no matter how bad the weather.
   When they pulled the old school down
   she still stood there every day:
   a pocketful of sweets for the little ones,
   smiles and a joke for the big ones.
   One day the lollipop lady
   was taken away to hospital.
   Without her standing there
   the corner looked, somehow, bare.
   After a month and two operations
   the lollipop lady died;
   the children felt something missing:
   she had made her final crossing.
   Now if you go down alone at dusk
   just before the streetlights go on,
   look closely at the corner over there:
   in the shadows by the lamp-post you’ll see her.
   Helping phantom children across the street,
   holding up the traffic with a ghostly hand;
   at the twilight crossing where four roads meet
   the phantom lollipop lady stands.
      Noble Jones from Wallasey, the bravest cat in the world
      Noble Jones is noble
      Noble Jones is strong
      Noble Jones goes round the place
      Defending right from wrong
      A smile upon his noble face
      Embodiment of feline grace
      He’s the pride of Merseyside
      The bravest cat in the world.
   A gang of desperadoes
   Had terrorized the land
   There were ugly scenes in Milton Keynes
   Till Noble took a hand
   He hounded them in Hounslow
   And tied some up in Tring
   He caught the rest in Crawley
   They couldn’t do a thing
   Single-pawed he beat them
   At their evil game
   Locked them up in Wormwood Scrubs
   And wouldn’t leave his name.
      For Noble Jones is modest
      And Noble Jones is strong
      Villains quake and start to shake
      When Noble comes along.
   Relaxing at New Brighton
   Curled up on the beach
   He saw a kitten drowning
   Swept from her parent’s reach
   Swiftly to the rescue
   He sprang into the waves
   Avoiding by a whisker
   A hero’s watery grave
   Safely from the Mersey
   He set her on the shore
   But when the crowd turned round to cheer
   He’d disappeared once more.
      For Noble Jones is modest
      And Noble Jones is shy
      People cheer, forget their fear
      When Noble passes by.
   One day at Watford Junction
   The brakes refused to function
   And the Inter-City nearly left the track
   With no fear of broken bones
   Down jumped brave Noble Jones
   Dug in his claws and hauled the engine back.
      As big as a crocodile’s toothbrush
      As huge as a dinosaur’s bones
      As large as an elephant’s hanky
      Is the heart of Noble Jones.
      In Cardiff and Camarthen
      They sang his praise aloud
      From Penrith down to Plymouth
      The did our hero proud
   When The Queen conferred his Knighthood
   A banner was unfurled
   SIR NOBLE JONES FROM WALLASEY
   THE BRAVEST CAT IN THE WORLD.
      For Noble Jones is noble
      And Noble Jones is strong
      Noble Jones goes round the place
      Defending right from wrong
      A smile upon his noble face
      Embodiment of feline grace
      He’s the pride of Merseyside
      The bravest cat in the world.

   Robocat
   Our new cat’s a robot
   He really is a sight
   No need to feed him Whiskas
   We just plug him in at night
   Faster than a speeding arrow
   He beats the mice to every hole
   Nothing’s safe from Supercat
   Pigeon, rat or vole
   Our new cat’s bionic
   His miaow can shatter glass
   He dug up next door’s gardent
   Then started on someone’s path
   The neighbours didn’t like him
   So they looked in the catalogue
   Clubbed together and ordered
   A bionic Superdog
   Now Rex is king of the Crescent
   Poor Tom won’t leave the house
   Won’t even play with his video game
   He’s afraid to touch the mouse
   Curled up next to his socket
   With a soft, electric purr
   Robocat’s a pussycat
   When Robodog is there.
   Short Poem
   I’m the shortest
   in our year.
   If you wrote a poem
   about me
   it’d only reach
   to here…
   Skipping Song
   A word in time
   saves nine
   Skip a word
   and save a rhyme
   Save a word
   and skip a rhyme
   A word in time saves nine
   A word in time
   saves nine
   Skip a line
   and miss a rhyme
   Miss a line
   and skip a rhyme
   A word in time
   saves nine
   The last line’s coming
   the last line’s coming
   the last line’s coming
   Ready or not.
   Some Other Guy
   ‘Trick or treat,’
   behind the mask
   I lurk in your street
   hoping for kisses.
   ‘A penny for the guy,’
   outside your gate
   I lie, disguised,
   wait for a smile.
   You warm your hands
   at someone else’s bonfire:
   rockets, Catherine-wheels explode
   in someone else’s garden.
   Song of the Earth
   Look deep into the hidden world of ponds.
   Mosses, tadpoles, the gently-moving fronds
   of water-crowfoot. Help clean up
   this tiny world. Curled tendrils of fern
   peer hopefully through bin-bags, chip-papers,
   choke on polystyrene. Green water
   fights for its breath amid the stink fo sewage,
   black rainbows of oil. Mersey and Alt,
   Dee and Weaver leave a cry for help
   with every tide. Our leavings mark
   their riverside.
   So bring in your wellies, bring in your macs,
   never mind sore feet or aching backs.
   Take a dawn walk on Hilbre. Wait
   in the silvery light to see the birds migrate.
   Clean up the Lowfields, clean up the beach,
   clear the canal and footpath, each of you
   can find a small thing to do
   to reciprocate. Give back the gifts
   of scabious and celandine, wood anemone
   and wild garlic, before it’s too late.
   So bring binoculars, notebook and pen,
   this land can be green and pleasant again.
   Families lark in the mud to trace the tiny creatures.
   A pond made safe for toad. Behind the motorways,
   the access-roads, the land shyly reveals its features.
   In Kirby a wood grows where one nearly died;
   look inside: see how new life starts
   beneath tyres and tin cans, boxes and shopping-carts.
   So bring your raincoats, bring your boots,
   dig in the earth and find your roots.
   Life is short but the earth is long
   put your ear to the ground and hear its song.
   Teacher’s Pet
   What sort of creature
   is a teacher’s pet?
   What sort of pet
   would a teacher get?
   Would it be a mongoose?
   Would it be a snake?
   Would it be a vampire
   with a thirst to slake?
   Would it be a bulldog
   or a Pekinese?
   Would it be a cuddly kitten
   or a tomcat full of fleas?
   Would it be a blue-eye?
   Would it be a swot?
   What sort of pet
   has your teacher got?
   The Dark
   I don’t like the dark coming down on my head
   It feels like a blanket thrown over the bed
   I don’t like the dark coming down on my head
   I don’t like the dark coming down over me
   It feels like the room’s full of things I can’t see
   I don’t like the dark coming down over me
   There isn’t enough light from under the door
   It only just reaches the edge of the floor
   There isn’t enough light from under the door
   I wish that my dad hadn’t put out the light
   It feels like there’s something that’s just out of sight
   I wish that my dad hadn’t put out the light
   But under the bedclothes it’s warm and secure
   You can’t see the ceiling you can’t see the floor
   Yes, under the bedclothes it’s warm and secure
   So I think I’ll stay here till it’s daylight once more.

   Dear Janine,
   A postcard from the edge
   of Africa. Impressions d'Afrique.
   Only a week, and already memories
   come and go, regular as the ferry,
   regular as thoughts of her, despite
   the catwalk grace of girls on the beach,
   each with an invisible load on her head;
   skin so black that it refracts the light,
   as evening sprawls across the harbour,
   staining dark red walls a darker red.
   I sit on the terrace for hours. The fish
   is delicious. Can't wait to paint
   the flowers. I want to stay.
   love,
   A.

   (in memoriam Slim Galliard)
   Cement mixer don't putty-putty no more
   Cement mixer don't putty-putty no more
   Cos my man Slim has gone to Lethe's shore
   There's silence down on 52nd Street
   Silence all down 52nd Street
   Couldn't hear the King of Vouti's beat
   Went to Laguna, watched the tide come in
   Went to Laguna, watched the tide come in
   Searched the beach but couldn't see my Slim

   Colden Valley, Early Spring
   Frost persists to afternoon
   on one side of this valley
   icicles depend
   the shadow of the other bank
   moves inexorably to the diagonal
   never allowing the daylight to fall
   here.
   Rich textures of lichen
   green elephant-hide of beeches
   palest sienna of bracken
   beckon in the March sunlight.
   Here there are only stones of purest marble
   frozen in small streams.
   The brightest afternoon
   cannot dispel the darkness
   beneath these stunted branches.
   The Day of the Dead, Hope Street
   silence in Hope Street
   silence in stony places
   after the agony in St. Luke's Gardens
   silence
   'Ladies and Gentlemen

   for one night only
   The Simultaneous and Historical Faces of
   Death!'
   fade in F.X. laughter
   faint boxy sound of cheap guitars
   songs torn from dried-up larynxes
   they dance
   ignoring double yellow lines
   around crimson traffic signs
   ROAD CLOSED
   noseless faces laugh elated
   clattering pasodobles
   echo from the walls of the Philharmonic Hall
   GRAN VERBENA DE CALAVERAS
   stretched across the street
   before the Cathedral's crowned nosecone
   pink   turquoise   ice blue
   sequinned skirts whirl
   faster and faster farandoles
   a lone black cat
   picks her way between the dancers
   heaped marigolds scream orange defiance
   the Consul white suit crumpled
   lounges in the doorway of the Philharmonic Pub
   tequila in hand
   bloodred tropical sunset
   reflected in his eyes
   Trauermusik:
   above the rattle of firecrackers
   raucous chords scrawled
   by bony fingers
   above high strings
   the pure clear sound of a viola
   a tall, black-bearded Irishman
   a short-haired girl in black ski-pants
   scarlet tin-soldier jacket
   peer through the crowd
   as white elbows snap
   doff their sombreros
   dance round their hats
   skeleton senoras
   elegant in pink-and-white boas
   watch stately
   their pinstriped husbands
   tap silverheaded cans to the rhythm
   confetti hurled in the air
   hot breath
   the smell mescal   enchiladas
   pink   white   yellow
   cellophaned flowers forgotten underfoot
   a black-and-white sheepdog
   sniffs our flesh round rotting bones
   lifts its leg against traffic cones
   calaveras    calaveras    calaveras
   prance castanets click
   quicken the rhythm of the dance
   at dusk
   the carnival departs
   hands yellow with the dust of mimosa
   hair braided with crimson carnations
   a trail of bright red petals
   trodden beneath her limping feet
   echoing distant laughter
   along the empty street
   Death of a Bird in the City
   (for Philip Jones Griffiths and his photographs)
   Guns are bombarding Piccadilly
   Firing at ten million splattered white dying birds
   Doors thrown open
   Girls mouths screaming
   The last unbearable white bird
   Spotlit, slowly struggling threshing against blackness
   Crucified on the easel
   SCHWEPPES
   GUINNESS IS ...
   The lights are going out ...
   A blind old woman with light running from her glasses
   Seeing nothing.
   The plaster Christ has got up and is kneeling before the plaster donkey
   Buildings are falling silently
   Neonsigns are running like blood
   The COCA-COLA sun is setting
   The plaster Mary following the star
   B.P.          MAXFACTOR
   To where the Three Kings lay
   The last bird has leapt weeping
   Onto the neon wheel
   Delicious
   REFRESHING
   Screaming through the echoing ruins of Piccadilly
   Under the bombardment of the night.

   Now the procession
                             THE MARCHING DRUMS
          hideous masked Breughel faces of old ladies in the crowd

   A touch more medium. Foreground
   oxide of chromium, splattered sap green,
   in between a zebra's stripes, carefully redrawn,
   off-white against brown-black. At the back
   a chatter of baboons burnt umber into the branches;
   a lone hyena skulks into sage-green.
   In the foreground, quick dabs, the shy eyes
   of impala. Catch them quick
   before they dry. Through the thorn trees
   black bulk of a rhino threatens the stretchers,
   the composition. Brushes washed
   at the waterhole. The image fades

   Love is a fanclub with only two fans
   Love is walking holding paintstained hands
   Love is
   Love is fish and chips on winter nights
   Love is blankets full of strange delights
   Love is when you don’t put out the light
   Love is
   Love is the presents in Christmas shops
   Love is when you’re feeling Top of the Pops
   Love is what happens when the music stops
   Love is
   Love is white panties lying all forlorn
   Love is a pink nightdress still slightly warm
   Love is when you have to leave at dawn
   Love is
   Love is you and love is me
   Love is a prison and love is free
   Love’s what’s there when you’re away from me

   Albion’s most lovely daughter sat on the banks of the Mersey
   dangling her landing stage in the water.
   The daughters of Albion
   arriving by underground at Central Station
   eating hot ecclescakes at the Pierhead
   writing « Billy Blake is Fab » on a wall in Mathew Street
   taking off their navyblue schooldrawers and
   putting on nylon panties ready for the night
   The daughters of Albion
   see the moonlight beating down on them in Bebington
   throw away their chewinggum ready for the goodnight kiss
   sleep in the dinnertime sunlight with old men
   looking up their skirts in St Johns Gardens
   comb their darkblonde hair in suburban bedrooms
   powder their delicate little nipples/wondering if tonight will
   be the night
   their bodies pressed into dresses or sweaters
   lavender at The Cavern or pink at The Sink
   The daughters of Albion wondering how to explain why they
   didn’t go home
   The daughters of Albion
   taking the dawn ferry to tomorrow
   worrying about what happened
   worrying about what hasn’t happened
   lacing up blue sneakers over brown ankles
   fastening up brown stockings to blue suspenderbelts
   Beautiful boys with bright red guitars

   Red Card
   Right from the off,
   straight into your penalty area
   a quick one-two and it was all over
   bar the shouting. Easy
   Easy sang the terraces.
   Half-time : I’ve given you a hundred per cent
   and more. Two down, and I’ve got it all
   to do again.
   At the end of the day
   the lap of honour. Your ribbons
   round the Cup. I am
   sick as a parrot. I am
   over the moon you tell the cameras,
   the waiting millions.
   Back home I walk
   alone.
  Snowman
   After I’d made a snowman
   I used to cry with the pain ;
   not out in the cold, but by the fire
   when my hands were warm again.
   It’s freezing here today ;
   sometimes it’s just the same :
   it’s when we’re warm together
   I suddenly feel the pain.
   Tonight at Noon *
   (for Charles Mingus and the Clayton Squares)
   Tonight at noon

   Tonight at noon

   Elephants will tell each other human jokes
   America will declare peace on Russia
   World War I generals will sell poppies in the streets on November 11th
   The first daffodils of autumn will appear
   When the leaves fall upwards to the trees
   Tonight at noon
   Pigeons will hunt cats through city backyards
   Hitler will tell us to fight on the beaches and on the landing fields
   A tunnel full of water will be built under Liverpool
   Pigs will be sighted flying in formation over Woolton
   and Nelson will not only get his eye back but his arm as well
   White Americans will demonstrate for equal rights
   in front of the Black House
   And the Monster has just created Dr Frankenstein
   Girls in bikinis are moonbathing
   Folksongs are being sung by real folk
   Art galleries are closed to people over 21
   Poets get their poems in the Top 20
   Politicians are elected to insane asylums
   There’s jobs for everyone and nobody wants them
   In back alleys everywhere teenage lovers are kissing
   in broad daylight
   In forgotten graveyards the dead will quietly bury the living
   and
   You will tell me you love me
   Tonight at noon.
  Winter Garden
There is a garden in her face
Where roses and white lilies grow
   The bathwater smelling of blackberries,
   my hair of white nettles, my body
   soaped with the scent of green ferns.
   We walked in the Botanical Gardens
   in winter. Small pink flowers
   against the gloom. Berries bloomed,
   cherry ripe. You rang, this morning.
   There is a garden in this place,
   of sorts. A lone honeysuckle
   huddles against the frost, that rimes
   the unchecked weeds of summer,
   brown stalks of lily-of-the-valley.
   O ruddier than the cherry,
   O brighter than the berry
   Tonight I meet you from the plane.
   All I can offer, once again,
   a winter garden,
   the smell of blackberries, green ferns,
   white nettles.
                                  Without You
   Without you every morning would be like going back to work after a
   holiday
   Without you I couldn’t stand the smell of the East Lancs Road,
   Without you ghost ferries would cross the Mersey manned by skeleton
   crews,
   Without you I’d probably feel happy and have more money and time and
   nothing to do with it,
   Without you I’d have to leave my stillborn poems on other people’s
   doorsteps, wrapped in brown paper,
   Without you there’d never be sauce to put on sausage butties,
   Without you plastic flowers in shop windows would just be plastic
   flowers in shop windows,
   Without you I’d spend my summers picking morosely over the remains of
   train crashes,
   Without you white birds would wrench themselves free from my paintings
   and fly off dripping blood into the night,
   Without you green apples wouldn’t taste greener,
   Without you Mothers wouldn’t let their children play out after tea,
   Without you every musician in the world would forget how to play the
   blues,
   Without you Public Houses would be public again,
   Without you the Sunday Times colour supplement would come out in
   black-and-white,
   Without you indifferent colonels would shrug their shoulders and press
   the button,
   Without you they’d stop changing the flowers in Piccadilly Gardens,
   Without you Clark Kent would forget how to become Superman,
   Without you Sunshine Breakfast would only consist of Cornflakes,
   Without you there’d be no colour in Magic colouring books,
   Without you Mahler’s 8th would only be performed by street musicians in
   derelict houses,
   Without you they’d forget to put the salt in every packet of crisps,
   Without you it would be an offence punishable by a fine of up to £200
   or two months’ imprisonment to be found in possession of curry powder,
   Without you riot police are massing in quiet sidestreets,
   Without you all streets would be one-way the other way,
   Without you there’d be no one not to kiss goodnight when we quarrel,
   Without you the first martian to land would turn round and go away
   again,
   Without you they’d forget to change the weather,
   Without you blind men would sell unlucky heather,
   Without you there would be
   no landscapes/ no stations/ no houses,
   no chipshops/ no quiet villages/ no seagulls
   on beaches/ no hopscotch on pavements/ no night/ no morning/ there’d be
   no city no country
   Without you.

   From Chrostine’s garden.

   I want to be
   In a dark warm place with you,
   Where no-one can hear me say
   ‘I love you’. Where I would slip between
   Your breath, where we would float,
   Between the notes, beyond the Isle of Capri,
   Where pain melts away
   Into gentle day.

    Morning, Liverpool 8
    In Blackburne Place and Canning Street
    the terraces half-wake,
    stretch their balconies;
    cast-iron railings, Ionic columns
    blink into daylight from
    a nightmare of bulldozers,
    dripping water, charred beams,
    distant dreams of hopscotch,
    hoofbeats on cobblestones. The mirror tells
    of a bright new face, does not reflect
    the past neglect. Hope Place
    and Huskisson tell of the nightmare
    almost gone.
   Morning, Sunset Heights
   Dogs bark
   down the canyon.
   A crow croaks
   its complimentary
   wake-u-up
   croak-o-gram;
   a hummingbird sips
   from the hibiscus.
   Bougainvillea
   glows. The sun
   hides behind thin mist
   'Have a nice day'
   ready on his lips.
   New York City Blues
   (for John Lennon)
   You do not cross the road
   To step into immortality
   An empty street is only the beginning
   The words will still flow through you
   Even on this cold pavement,
   Are heard in some far place
   Remote from flowers or flash-bulbs.
   In that city, on Gothic railings
   Dark against the snowy park
   Still a dead flower, a faded letter,
   Already one month old.
   "Life is what happens to you
   When you're busy making other plans,"
   This empty street
   Is only the beginning.
   Here, in your other city,
   Riot vans prowl the December dark,
   Remember angry embers of summer,
   Familiar ghost guitars echo from stucco terraces.
   Meanwhile, in the Valley of Indecision,
   We rehearse stale words, store up expected songs,
   Celebrate sad anniversaries.
   Flowers and flash-bulbs. Cold pavements.
   You do not cross the road
   To step into immortality
   At the dark end of the street
   Waits the inevitable stranger.

   Hitch their horses to a bus terminal
   Sun on their shirts sweat on their faces sust caking their jeans

   The smell of grass being mowed in the square;
   I sit in a café in Piccadilly
   And think of Yves Tanguy
   Alone in the crowded dugout eating sandwiches full of spiders.

   Standing in the queue
   Wondering what it's like
   To buy groceries for two.
   Salad Poem
   (for Henri Rousseau le Douanier)
   The sun is shining outside
   Henri Rousseau (Gentil Rousseau)
   The sky is blue
   like your skies
   I want to paint the salad
   on the table
   bright crisp green red purple
   lettuce and radishes, ham and tomatoes
   Paint them like your jungles
   Gentle Rousseau
   I want to paint
   All things bright and beautiful
   All salads great and small
   I want to make
   Blue skies bluer
   Green grass greener
   Pink flowers brighter
   Like you
   Henri Rousseau.
   Souvenirs
   (for John and Anne Willett)
   Chocolate sardines, torn election-posters MAR
   CHAIS, huddled sheep before a distant sepia
   view of Pourville. The yellow-and-grey world
   of Lords and Ladies on the wallpaper in
   the lingerie. Lemon light. Night hydrangeas.
   The smell of the ferry, scrubbed mussels
   deep blue in a white bowl in the electric kitchen,
   where moths beat against the windowpane. Blinding
   rain that wipes away the cliffs at Etretat.
   Green depths of evening sous-bois, tall trees
   that shutter the light along the banks outside
   the villages. A black workman's suit, a sailor's cap
   bought beside St Jacques. Oeufs de Pâques.
   Andouillettes, and mackerel cooked with driftwood
   on the beach. Each stone that I've brought home
   since 1968. Late light across the harvestfields
   from Ambrumesnil. Cattle dream, creamy as caramel.
   The smell across the valley from the Nescafé factory.
   The tall gingko tree that split ten years ago,
   one twin trunk that still lies overgrown,
   immutable as memory.

   1          Try to imagine your next hangover
   2          Travel on the Woodside ferry with your eyes closed. Travel
   back with them open.
   3          Look for a black cat. Stoke it. This will be either lucky or
   unlucky.
   4          Find a plastic flower. Hold it up to the light.
   5          Next time you see someone mowing a lawn smell the smell of
   freshly cut grass.
   6          Watch Coronation Street. Listen to the ‘B’’ side of the
   latest Dusty Springfield record.
   7          Sit in a city square in the sunlight. Remember the first
   time you made love.
   8          Look at every poster you pass next time you’re on a bus.
   9          The next time you clean your teeth think about what you’re
   doing.
                                    The Bell
                                    The bell
                              tolled all afternoon
                             we did not send to ask
                                   for whom.
                               It told of flowers
                             heaped in a goalmouth,
                              red and blue scarves
                          heaped together at an altar;
                                   it told of
                             eyes like T.V. screens
                        haunted by last night's images,
                         tears dried by the April wind.
                           As the flags at half-mast
                                stirred overhead
                                 the deep bell
                           still tolled in our heads
                         long after the light had gone.
   The Parsonage, Haworth
   In the earth, the earth thou shalt be laid,
   A grey stone standing over thee;
   Black mould beneath thee spread,
   And black mould to cover thee.
   Emily Brontë
   Gravestones piled deep as fallen leaves,
   trodden into the sodden ground;
   last consumptive flush of Autumn
   in the sycamores;
   a kissing-gate swings disused
   in the bitter wind.
   Cries of crows, rattle of rain,
   on the nursery windowpane;
   insistent tick of the grandfather clock,
   insistent tock of the stonemason's hammer,
   stammered epitaphs
   swathed in lichened green.
   It is not the stone that eats their bodies,
   but the black spring that runs through them
   that feeds the dark sarcophagus.
   A glimpse of sun
   sudden as a blush suffusing soft cheeks;
   pale blue eyes
   calling through blonde coppices of hair
   across the dimpled moors.
   The White Ball
   (after Ivan Puni: 'Construction With White Ball', 1915)
   'What is this?'
   the eager museum lady asks;
   'A Ball!' 'A Ball!'
   chorus the children.
   She tosses them words –
   'synthesis', 'construction', 'colour' –
   they wait in vain
   to catch a white ball.
   Adrian Henri's Talking Toxteth Blues
   Well, I woke up this morning, there was buzzing overhead
   Saw the helicopter as I got out of my bed,
   Smelt the smell of burning, saw the buildings fall,
   Bulldozers pulling down next door's wall.
   Toxteth nightmare …
   … yes …
   … city with a hangover.
   Then I remembered what happened last night
   The sirens and the shouting and the TV lights,
   Banging on the riotshields, petrol bombs in flames,
   Cars all ablazing, shattered window-frames.
   Felt sick to my stomach …
   … don't cry for me …
   … Upper Parly.
   Saw a busy lying blood pouring from his head,
   Saw one stop a paving stone, thought that he was dead.
   Heard the sound of engines in the bright orange night,
   Saw the headlights blazing, saw the crowd in flight.
   One of them …
   … didn't run fast enough …
   … Land Rovers …
   … long way from the farm.
   Well, I saw the Chief Constable up on TV
   And the Superintendents, but they never saw me,
   Saw the Home Secretary and the Minister for Riots,
   And all them social workers who just never keep quiet.
   … never met a one of them …
   … neither did the coppers.
   Saw a woman walking in the firelight's glare,
   "Hey, Aunty Maggy, what you doing there?"
   Arms full of liquor and a portable TV,
   Said, "All the rest are doing it, why not me?
   … do yourself a favour, son,
   … nice music centre …
   … over there.’’
   Well, I thought a bit about it and I took her advice
   Crowd was having fun and the goods looked nice,
   Then a scuffer copped me and they threw me in a van,
   Took me off to Risley and the Magistrate Man.
   … exemplary sentence …
   … act as a deterrent …
   … law 'n' order …
   … Toxteth nightmare ….
   … city …
   … with a
   hangover.
                             We Won’t Forget That
   we won't forget that
   that we laughed, laughed that
   much I'll never forget that
   that we laughed that much, will we?
   and we'll never forget be-
   cause we laughed that much and
   won't forget my God how much we laughed
   and not and never forget that we laughed so
   much because we were together
   and laughed so much
   we'll never forget that
   What Were You Thinking About ?
   Dressed and then dressed again
   what were you thinking about
   undressed
   I left my mink in the hallway
   and we went into the desert
   We lived on love and cold water
   we loved each other in our poverty
   we even ate our dirty linen in public
   and on the black sand tablecloth
   the sunlight spread its golden dishes
   We loved each other in our poverty
   we lived on love and cold water
   my body your freehold property.
