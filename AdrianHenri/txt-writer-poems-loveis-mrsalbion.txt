                   Mrs Albion, You’ve Got a Lovely Daughter
                              (for Allen Ginsberg)


   Albion’s most lovely daughter sat on the banks of the Mersey
   dangling her landing stage in the water.

   The daughters of Albion
   arriving by underground at Central Station
   eating hot ecclescakes at the Pierhead
   writing « Billy Blake is Fab » on a wall in Mathew Street

   taking off their navyblue schooldrawers and
   putting on nylon panties ready for the night

   The daughters of Albion
   see the moonlight beating down on them in Bebington
   throw away their chewinggum ready for the goodnight kiss
   sleep in the dinnertime sunlight with old men
   looking up their skirts in St Johns Gardens
   comb their darkblonde hair in suburban bedrooms
   powder their delicate little nipples/wondering if tonight will
   be the night
   their bodies pressed into dresses or sweaters
   lavender at The Cavern or pink at The Sink

   The daughters of Albion wondering how to explain why they
   didn’t go home

   The daughters of Albion
   taking the dawn ferry to tomorrow
   worrying about what happened
   worrying about what hasn’t happened
   lacing up blue sneakers over brown ankles
   fastening up brown stockings to blue suspenderbelts

   Beautiful boys with bright red guitars
   in the spaces between the stars

   Reelin’ an’ a-rockin’
   Wishin’ an’ a-hopin’
   Kissin’ an’ a-prayin’
   Lovin’ an’ a-layin’

   Mrs Albion, you’ve got a lovely daughter.
