                             We Wonâ€™t Forget That


   we won't forget that
   that we laughed, laughed that
   much I'll never forget that
   that we laughed that much, will we?
   and we'll never forget be-
   cause we laughed that much and
   won't forget my God how much we laughed
   and not and never forget that we laughed so
   much because we were together
   and laughed so much
   we'll never forget that
