BEGIN NOW    Imagine you’ve been shot into space. You’re going to be counting the END
BEGIN NOW    years on your fingers. To fill up some of your time, between the END
BEGIN NOW    science and flying, what would you take – music or books? Or would you END
BEGIN NOW    have to take both? There’s absolutely no doubt that we’d want to take END
BEGIN NOW    them both, or rather that our very clever, never needs re-charging iPod END
BEGIN NOW    would be full of both poems and tunes. END
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused takes words and music – poets and musicians – and END
BEGIN NOW    mixes them up to create gorgeous lyrical feasts for music lovers and END
BEGIN NOW    secret wordsmiths alike. It’s not necessarily clever, but it is a whole END
BEGIN NOW    lot of fun… END
BEGIN NOW    Since 2004 we’ve been exploring our hunch that music fans can be END
BEGIN NOW    encouraged to attend more live literature events, under the banner END
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused. With 3 successful national tours, one of events and END
BEGIN NOW    a regular presence on the festival circuit already under our belts, END
BEGIN NOW    we’ve learned a lot along the way about who comes and why and about how END
BEGIN NOW    music promoters are interested in getting more involved in live END
BEGIN NOW    literature. END

BEGIN NOW    Until 2010, P&C was a project within the ‘stable’ of the hub, an arts END
BEGIN NOW    development practice which combines research, consultancy and training END
BEGIN NOW    with work as a creative producer (see [10]www.thehubuk.com). In late END
BEGIN NOW    2010, we decided that the time had come for us to take the stabilisers END
BEGIN NOW    off the P&C bike, and to go it alone, and so we established Phrased & END
BEGIN NOW    Confused as an independent organisation. This decision reflected the END
BEGIN NOW    track record we’d established since 2004, and also the growing ambition END
BEGIN NOW    of our programme, along with our desire to develop year-round END
BEGIN NOW    professional development support for promoters around the country, and END
BEGIN NOW    – finally – the scale of the opportunity presented by the Phrased & END
BEGIN NOW    Confused TV digital platform. You can find out more about this on our END

BEGIN NOW    How to be ambitious and bold without being gimmicky? END
BEGIN NOW    How to capture the chaotic ‘happening’ spirit of [11]Adrian Henri while END
BEGIN NOW    saying something coherent? END
BEGIN NOW    How to spark off the Mersey poets’ work without writing something END
BEGIN NOW    hackneyed? END
BEGIN NOW    These are the exciting maddening challenges I’ve been exploring so far END
BEGIN NOW    in the development of Liverpool I love your horny handed tons of soil, END
BEGIN NOW    a collaborative performance bringing together spoken word, live music END
BEGIN NOW    and digital art forms. The title is taken from a fragment poem by END
BEGIN NOW    Adrian Henri and captures the passion, energy and sense of longing that END
BEGIN NOW    I want to put on stage when we perform 15 mins from the piece at the END
BEGIN NOW    [12]Liverpool Philharmonic Music Rooms on March 18th. The piece will END
BEGIN NOW    look at what’s been lost and found in the re-sculpting of the Liverpool END
BEGIN NOW    landscape in the past fifty years, exploring the layering of past END
BEGIN NOW    present and imagination when we look at the buildings around us. I came END
BEGIN NOW    across this quotation from Adrian Henri last week and it reassured me END
BEGIN NOW    that we’re on the right track with our thematic ideas: END
BEGIN NOW    ‘The architecture which springs most directly from the imagination, and END
BEGIN NOW    which appeals most directly to it, belongs in one way or another to END
BEGIN NOW    naïve or primitive consciousness. It is not conceived as a finished END
BEGIN NOW    work, but grows; it works by extension, addition, subtraction.’ END
BEGIN NOW    And maybe that’s the way we’re going to put our piece together too: END
BEGIN NOW    bringing together seemingly disparate parts, allowing something to grow END
BEGIN NOW    uninhibited, following our instincts. While I’m working with long time END
BEGIN NOW    musical collaborators  Vidar Norheim and Martin Heslop, I’m also being END
BEGIN NOW    pushed way out of my comfort zone through conversations with digital END
BEGIN NOW    makers at [13]DOES Liverpool led by Adrian McEwen, a man capable of END
BEGIN NOW    connecting almost anything to the internet (see his ‘internet of END
BEGIN NOW    things’ project). If there’s a way to connect poetry to digital END
BEGIN NOW    robotics then I promise we’ll find it. END
BEGIN NOW    I’ve also been talking psycho-geography with Jonathan Sharma of [14]K2 END
BEGIN NOW    architects who showed me architectural images, describing the way END
BEGIN NOW    they’re built up through layering (what was there, what will be there, END
BEGIN NOW    photographs, pencil drawings etc): a pleasingly tidy metaphor for our END
BEGIN NOW    layering of feeling and perspective in relation to the streets we live END
BEGIN NOW    in. END
BEGIN NOW    Just to make the mix of ideas richer, on March 5rd Vidar and I will END
BEGIN NOW    join visual artists Louise Flooks and Holly * for a session with END
BEGIN NOW    [15]Unity Theatre’s [16]Splatterdays kids group, uncovering how the END
BEGIN NOW    city looks through a child’s eyes and how it might be re-imagined END
BEGIN NOW    through play. They’ll be building 3-D models of landscapes and houses, END
BEGIN NOW    drawing their ideal Liverpool. I want to know how free they feel in the END
BEGIN NOW    Liverpool, whether they have enough space, whether they believe they END
BEGIN NOW    can have adventures and where those adventures could take them. END
BEGIN NOW    So with just three weeks to solve this brilliant muddle, I’m END
BEGIN NOW    channelling the anarchic spirit of Adrian Henri and trusting that out END
BEGIN NOW    of this collision of the primitive and the high-tech, of poetry and END
BEGIN NOW    code, of old and new Liverpool, something whole and beautiful will END
BEGIN NOW    spring. END
BEGIN NOW [6]Research END
BEGIN NOW    At Phrased & Confused, we’re unashamedly proud of our data geek END
BEGIN NOW    anoraks. However, our geekiness is offset by a strong belief that END
BEGIN NOW    research is a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. When we END
BEGIN NOW    set out to do some research it’s because we want to know the answer to END
BEGIN NOW    some questions that are bugging us, or because we want to get inside a END
BEGIN NOW    particular issue, or know more about our audiences. We want to know all END
BEGIN NOW    this because it helps us to measure what we’re doing, and to plan what END
BEGIN NOW    we might do in the future. END
BEGIN NOW    When we’re not working on bringing great music and spoken word to you, END
BEGIN NOW    some of us spend our time crunching those numbers and chewing the END
BEGIN NOW    spoken word cud. Over the years we’ve done various pieces of research. END
BEGIN NOW    Here’s a summary of some of them… END
BEGIN NOW    Audience Research END
BEGIN NOW    We’re big on audience research. We have to be, because our aim with END
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused is to attract new people to spoken word, and we need END
BEGIN NOW    to know if all our hard efforts are doing that. So, we try to come up END
BEGIN NOW    with lateral thinking ways of getting you guys to tell us more about END
BEGIN NOW    you and what you think of us. It’s our way of getting us introduced to END
BEGIN NOW    each other. END
BEGIN NOW    Here are some of the things you’ve told us at [7]Summer Sundae in 2009… END
BEGIN NOW    • 51% of you were aged 25 or under END
BEGIN NOW    • 91% of you had been to more than 3 music gigs in the previous 12 END
BEGIN NOW    months, and 42% to more than 10 END
BEGIN NOW    • Meanwhile, 57% of you said you’d been to ‘1 or 2’ spoken word events END
BEGIN NOW    in the same period – but anecdotal feedback suggests that this may well END
BEGIN NOW    have been at our own P&C tent or fringe gig. END
BEGIN NOW    • Only 19% of you had been to a spoken word tent at another festival, END
BEGIN NOW    suggesting that Phrased & Confused reaches audiences other spoken word END
BEGIN NOW    brands can’t! END
BEGIN NOW    • 64% of you said that having checked out Phrased & Confused you END
BEGIN NOW    intended to go to further spoken word events in the future END
BEGIN NOW    • 64% of you had listened to artist tracks on the Phrased & Confused END
BEGIN NOW    USB wristband you picked up at the festival END
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused TV – Feasibility Research END
BEGIN NOW    In 2009 we secured Arts Council England support for a research project END
BEGIN NOW    to “explore the potential for a bespoke digital platform for spoken END
BEGIN NOW    word, which would harness the audience development potential of digital END
BEGIN NOW    technology, enable UK-based artists to develop relationships with END
BEGIN NOW    global consumers, able to ‘mainline’ their live literature on demand, END
BEGIN NOW    via their PCs, MP3 players or mobile phones”. Later that year, we END
BEGIN NOW    collected feedback from our festival audiences, and in the first half END
BEGIN NOW    of 2010 we turned our attention to those working in the sector. We used END
BEGIN NOW    this feedback to help us model how a digital platform (provisionally END
BEGIN NOW    called Phrased & Confused TV) might best be delivered, scoping out the END
BEGIN NOW    platform’s functionality, testing and spec-ing out the most appropriate END
BEGIN NOW    ‘front’ and back end’ models for the platform and exploring income END
BEGIN NOW    generation opportunities. We then moved onto drill down in more detail END
BEGIN NOW    into: vision and aims; the offer to artists, arts organisations and END
BEGIN NOW    audiences; the platform model; skills development programme; content; END
BEGIN NOW    evaluation, audience and user research and benchmarking; marketing; HR; END
BEGIN NOW    timetable, and financial projections. END
BEGIN NOW    All this work means that we’re confident that we’ve got the P&C TV END
BEGIN NOW    ‘offer’ right. We’ve ‘walked through’ the project to put together a END
BEGIN NOW    detailed operational structure and job descriptions, budget and END
BEGIN NOW    timeline. So far, so feasible. Turning to the figures, our research END
BEGIN NOW    into the potential to generate earned income potential confirmed that, END
BEGIN NOW    at present, it’s pretty nigh impossible for niche platforms such as END
BEGIN NOW    this to do this to any real extent. It’s a tough time to be fundraising END
BEGIN NOW    and the biggest question mark is over financial viability. Our END
BEGIN NOW    fundraising research points to a number of possibilities, but success END
BEGIN NOW    here – and the feasibility of the project – will depend on: potential END
BEGIN NOW    funders’ willingness and ability to join us in testing our proposition. END
BEGIN NOW    We’re actively working on all of this now, so join our mailing list to END
BEGIN NOW    stay up to date with developments. END
BEGIN NOW [7]Skills Development END
BEGIN NOW    As well as being creative producers, the Phrased & Confused team also END
BEGIN NOW    has a strong track record for its training, mentoring and broader END

BEGIN NOW    specific projects for spoken word artists, promoters and producers, END
BEGIN NOW    including a unique commissioning scheme that helps artists to create END
BEGIN NOW    new work, and a training programme that helps emerging promoters to END
BEGIN NOW    develop their business-related skills. It’s work that we really believe END
BEGIN NOW    in, not only because of its value to those we support and the impact it END
BEGIN NOW    has on the wider scene, but also because it enables us to share what END
BEGIN NOW    we’ve learnt and – selfishly – it helps us to get better at what we do END
BEGIN NOW    too! END

BEGIN NOW    Developing artists via our tours END
BEGIN NOW    When we go out on the road, it’s not enough for our artists to simply END
