  Winter Garden



There is a garden in her face
Where roses and white lilies grow

   The bathwater smelling of blackberries,
   my hair of white nettles, my body
   soaped with the scent of green ferns.

   We walked in the Botanical Gardens
   in winter. Small pink flowers
   against the gloom. Berries bloomed,
   cherry ripe. You rang, this morning.
   There is a garden in this place,
   of sorts. A lone honeysuckle
   huddles against the frost, that rimes
   the unchecked weeds of summer,
   brown stalks of lily-of-the-valley.

   O ruddier than the cherry,
   O brighter than the berry

   Tonight I meet you from the plane.
   All I can offer, once again,
   a winter garden,
   the smell of blackberries, green ferns,
   white nettles.
