                              AMERICA  (extracts)


   A Confidential Report to Dr Bertolt Brecht on the Present Condition of
   The United States of America

   "America, fabulous meltingpot!
   God's own country!
   Just called by the initials,
   USA,
   Like everybody's boyhood friend, incapable of change!"

     Bert Brecht, "Vanished Glory of New York the Giant City"

   Loew's Midtown Motor Inn.    8th Ave between 48th and 49th Streets, New
   York, NY 10019

   sunset helicopters Hudson river
   from my 11th-story window

   waking to red-and-black funnels behind the buildings
   noise of rockdrills police sirens waking me every morning
   RHEINGOLD, THE TEN-MINUTE HEADACHE

   terrible heat like an oven between the buildings
    14.IX.69


   On Broadway
   3 black prostitutes
   beautiful
   standing like the Supremes
   about to sing "Stop
   in the Name of Love"
   as I walk round the corner
   Al Kooper tired nervous cowboy
   at home
   playing the electric keyboard

   The Dixie Restaurant: Closed for Jewish New Year

   Television: hideous quizgames

   day         Batman
   and     The Addams family
   night    stockmarket quotations
   Castle: for Malcolm Morley
   man in a sail boat
   placed there by the invisible hand
   motionless for ever
   not wondering why
   stones as real as painted clouds
   at the hard white edges the dream fades
   in the hard white empty studio

   justify right - - - - -for John Clem Clarke
   drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweed
   in the St Adrian Co.
   painted Cavaliers quietly watched me get pissed
   bright lights Coney Island on Bleeker St
   yellow taxi home

   AlIen stumbling walk guide to the nightworld
   buying egg creams at the allnight Gem Spa
   dirty faded sign FIVE-SPOT
   trashcans car engines mattresses
   meeting a man carrying a shining bikewheel
   in dark wiremesh Tomkins Square
   strange beautiful cracked voice
   autoharp dulcimer songs of Innocence and Experience
   lambs dancing on the hillsides
   poet burying his face in the rainsoaked grass
   dark streets distant glass breaking
   home in a yellow taxi
   the girl who sits next to me in the hotel coffeeshop
   furcoat worrying about her acne eating a hot fudge sundae
   Ohio Landscape from the air
   patterns of township
   clumps of red gold orange trees
   pale clay streaked
   round green ponds reflecting the sun
   rows of parked cars
   shining like child's glass beads in the sunlight
