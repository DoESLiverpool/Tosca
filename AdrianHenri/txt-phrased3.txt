BEGIN NOW [7]AboutEND
BEGIN NOW    Imagine you’ve been shot into space. You’re going to be counting theEND
BEGIN NOW    years on your fingers. To fill up some of your time, between theEND
BEGIN NOW    science and flying, what would you take – music or books? Or would youEND
BEGIN NOW    have to take both? There’s absolutely no doubt that we’d want to takeEND
BEGIN NOW    them both, or rather that our very clever, never needs re-charging iPodEND
BEGIN NOW    would be full of both poems and tunes.END
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused takes words and music – poets and musicians – andEND
BEGIN NOW    mixes them up to create gorgeous lyrical feasts for music lovers andEND
BEGIN NOW    secret wordsmiths alike. It’s not necessarily clever, but it is a wholeEND
BEGIN NOW    lot of fun…END
BEGIN NOW    Since 2004 we’ve been exploring our hunch that music fans can beEND
BEGIN NOW    encouraged to attend more live literature events, under the bannerEND
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused. With 3 successful national tours, one of events andEND
BEGIN NOW    a regular presence on the festival circuit already under our belts,END
BEGIN NOW    we’ve learned a lot along the way about who comes and why and about howEND
BEGIN NOW    music promoters are interested in getting more involved in liveEND
BEGIN NOW    literature.END

BEGIN NOW    Until 2010, P&C was a project within the ‘stable’ of the hub, an artsEND
BEGIN NOW    development practice which combines research, consultancy and trainingEND
BEGIN NOW    with work as a creative producer (see [10]www.thehubuk.com). In lateEND
BEGIN NOW    2010, we decided that the time had come for us to take the stabilisersEND
BEGIN NOW    off the P&C bike, and to go it alone, and so we established Phrased &END
BEGIN NOW    Confused as an independent organisation. This decision reflected theEND
BEGIN NOW    track record we’d established since 2004, and also the growing ambitionEND
BEGIN NOW    of our programme, along with our desire to develop year-roundEND
BEGIN NOW    professional development support for promoters around the country, andEND
BEGIN NOW    – finally – the scale of the opportunity presented by the Phrased &END
BEGIN NOW    Confused TV digital platform. You can find out more about this on ourEND

BEGIN NOW    The architecture of the imaginationEND
BEGIN NOW    Adrian-Henri1END
BEGIN NOW    How to be ambitious and bold without being gimmicky?END
BEGIN NOW    How to capture the chaotic ‘happening’ spirit of [11]Adrian Henri whileEND
BEGIN NOW    saying something coherent?END
BEGIN NOW    How to spark off the Mersey poets’ work without writing somethingEND
BEGIN NOW    hackneyed?END
BEGIN NOW    These are the exciting maddening challenges I’ve been exploring so farEND
BEGIN NOW    in the development of Liverpool I love your horny handed tons of soil,END
BEGIN NOW    a collaborative performance bringing together spoken word, live musicEND
BEGIN NOW    and digital art forms. The title is taken from a fragment poem byEND
BEGIN NOW    Adrian Henri and captures the passion, energy and sense of longing thatEND
BEGIN NOW    I want to put on stage when we perform 15 mins from the piece at theEND
BEGIN NOW    [12]Liverpool Philharmonic Music Rooms on March 18th. The piece willEND
BEGIN NOW    look at what’s been lost and found in the re-sculpting of the LiverpoolEND
BEGIN NOW    landscape in the past fifty years, exploring the layering of pastEND
BEGIN NOW    present and imagination when we look at the buildings around us. I cameEND
BEGIN NOW    across this quotation from Adrian Henri last week and it reassured meEND
BEGIN NOW    that we’re on the right track with our thematic ideas:END
BEGIN NOW    ‘The architecture which springs most directly from the imagination, andEND
BEGIN NOW    which appeals most directly to it, belongs in one way or another toEND
BEGIN NOW    naïve or primitive consciousness. It is not conceived as a finishedEND
BEGIN NOW    work, but grows; it works by extension, addition, subtraction.’END
BEGIN NOW    And maybe that’s the way we’re going to put our piece together too:END
BEGIN NOW    bringing together seemingly disparate parts, allowing something to growEND
BEGIN NOW    uninhibited, following our instincts. While I’m working with long timeEND
BEGIN NOW    musical collaborators  Vidar Norheim and Martin Heslop, I’m also beingEND
BEGIN NOW    pushed way out of my comfort zone through conversations with digitalEND
BEGIN NOW    makers at [13]DOES Liverpool led by Adrian McEwen, a man capable ofEND
BEGIN NOW    connecting almost anything to the internet (see his ‘internet ofEND
BEGIN NOW    things’ project). If there’s a way to connect poetry to digitalEND
BEGIN NOW    robotics then I promise we’ll find it.END
BEGIN NOW    I’ve also been talking psycho-geography with Jonathan Sharma of [14]K2END
BEGIN NOW    architects who showed me architectural images, describing the wayEND
BEGIN NOW    they’re built up through layering (what was there, what will be there,END
BEGIN NOW    photographs, pencil drawings etc): a pleasingly tidy metaphor for ourEND
BEGIN NOW    layering of feeling and perspective in relation to the streets we liveEND
BEGIN NOW    in.END
BEGIN NOW    Just to make the mix of ideas richer, on March 5rd Vidar and I willEND
BEGIN NOW    join visual artists Louise Flooks and Holly * for a session withEND
BEGIN NOW    [15]Unity Theatre’s [16]Splatterdays kids group, uncovering how theEND
BEGIN NOW    city looks through a child’s eyes and how it might be re-imaginedEND
BEGIN NOW    through play. They’ll be building 3-D models of landscapes and houses,END
BEGIN NOW    drawing their ideal Liverpool. I want to know how free they feel in theEND
BEGIN NOW    Liverpool, whether they have enough space, whether they believe theyEND
BEGIN NOW    can have adventures and where those adventures could take them.END
BEGIN NOW    So with just three weeks to solve this brilliant muddle, I’mEND
BEGIN NOW    channelling the anarchic spirit of Adrian Henri and trusting that outEND
BEGIN NOW    of this collision of the primitive and the high-tech, of poetry andEND
BEGIN NOW    code, of old and new Liverpool, something whole and beautiful willEND
BEGIN NOW    spring.END
BEGIN NOW [6]ResearchEND
BEGIN NOW    At Phrased & Confused, we’re unashamedly proud of our data geekEND
BEGIN NOW    anoraks. However, our geekiness is offset by a strong belief thatEND
BEGIN NOW    research is a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. When weEND
BEGIN NOW    set out to do some research it’s because we want to know the answer toEND
BEGIN NOW    some questions that are bugging us, or because we want to get inside aEND
BEGIN NOW    particular issue, or know more about our audiences. We want to know allEND
BEGIN NOW    this because it helps us to measure what we’re doing, and to plan whatEND
BEGIN NOW    we might do in the future.END
BEGIN NOW    When we’re not working on bringing great music and spoken word to you,END
BEGIN NOW    some of us spend our time crunching those numbers and chewing theEND
BEGIN NOW    spoken word cud. Over the years we’ve done various pieces of research.END
BEGIN NOW    Here’s a summary of some of them…END
BEGIN NOW    Audience ResearchEND
BEGIN NOW    We’re big on audience research. We have to be, because our aim withEND
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused is to attract new people to spoken word, and we needEND
BEGIN NOW    to know if all our hard efforts are doing that. So, we try to come upEND
BEGIN NOW    with lateral thinking ways of getting you guys to tell us more aboutEND
BEGIN NOW    you and what you think of us. It’s our way of getting us introduced toEND
BEGIN NOW    each other.END
BEGIN NOW    Here are some of the things you’ve told us at [7]Summer Sundae in 2009…END
BEGIN NOW    • 51% of you were aged 25 or underEND
BEGIN NOW    • 91% of you had been to more than 3 music gigs in the previous 12END
BEGIN NOW    months, and 42% to more than 10END
BEGIN NOW    • Meanwhile, 57% of you said you’d been to ‘1 or 2’ spoken word eventsEND
BEGIN NOW    in the same period – but anecdotal feedback suggests that this may wellEND
BEGIN NOW    have been at our own P&C tent or fringe gig.END
BEGIN NOW    • Only 19% of you had been to a spoken word tent at another festival,END
BEGIN NOW    suggesting that Phrased & Confused reaches audiences other spoken wordEND
BEGIN NOW    brands can’t!END
BEGIN NOW    • 64% of you said that having checked out Phrased & Confused youEND
BEGIN NOW    intended to go to further spoken word events in the futureEND
BEGIN NOW    • 64% of you had listened to artist tracks on the Phrased & ConfusedEND
BEGIN NOW    USB wristband you picked up at the festivalEND
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused TV – Feasibility ResearchEND
BEGIN NOW    In 2009 we secured Arts Council England support for a research projectEND
BEGIN NOW    to “explore the potential for a bespoke digital platform for spokenEND
BEGIN NOW    word, which would harness the audience development potential of digitalEND
BEGIN NOW    technology, enable UK-based artists to develop relationships withEND
BEGIN NOW    global consumers, able to ‘mainline’ their live literature on demand,END
BEGIN NOW    via their PCs, MP3 players or mobile phones”. Later that year, weEND
BEGIN NOW    collected feedback from our festival audiences, and in the first halfEND
BEGIN NOW    of 2010 we turned our attention to those working in the sector. We usedEND
BEGIN NOW    this feedback to help us model how a digital platform (provisionallyEND
BEGIN NOW    called Phrased & Confused TV) might best be delivered, scoping out theEND
BEGIN NOW    platform’s functionality, testing and spec-ing out the most appropriateEND
BEGIN NOW    ‘front’ and back end’ models for the platform and exploring incomeEND
BEGIN NOW    generation opportunities. We then moved onto drill down in more detailEND
BEGIN NOW    into: vision and aims; the offer to artists, arts organisations andEND
BEGIN NOW    audiences; the platform model; skills development programme; content;END
BEGIN NOW    evaluation, audience and user research and benchmarking; marketing; HR;END
BEGIN NOW    timetable, and financial projections.END
BEGIN NOW    All this work means that we’re confident that we’ve got the P&C TVEND
BEGIN NOW    ‘offer’ right. We’ve ‘walked through’ the project to put together aEND
BEGIN NOW    detailed operational structure and job descriptions, budget andEND
BEGIN NOW    timeline. So far, so feasible. Turning to the figures, our researchEND
BEGIN NOW    into the potential to generate earned income potential confirmed that,END
BEGIN NOW    at present, it’s pretty nigh impossible for niche platforms such asEND
BEGIN NOW    this to do this to any real extent. It’s a tough time to be fundraisingEND
BEGIN NOW    and the biggest question mark is over financial viability. OurEND
BEGIN NOW    fundraising research points to a number of possibilities, but successEND
BEGIN NOW    here – and the feasibility of the project – will depend on: potentialEND
BEGIN NOW    funders’ willingness and ability to join us in testing our proposition.END
BEGIN NOW    We’re actively working on all of this now, so join our mailing list toEND
BEGIN NOW    stay up to date with developments.END

BEGIN NOW    including a unique commissioning scheme that helps artists to createEND
BEGIN NOW    new work, and a training programme that helps emerging promoters toEND
BEGIN NOW    develop their business-related skills. It’s work that we really believeEND
BEGIN NOW    in, not only because of its value to those we support and the impact itEND
