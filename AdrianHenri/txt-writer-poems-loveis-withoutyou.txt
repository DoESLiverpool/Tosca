                                  Without You

   Without you every morning would be like going back to work after a
   holiday
   Without you I couldn’t stand the smell of the East Lancs Road,
   Without you ghost ferries would cross the Mersey manned by skeleton
   crews,
   Without you I’d probably feel happy and have more money and time and
   nothing to do with it,
   Without you I’d have to leave my stillborn poems on other people’s
   doorsteps, wrapped in brown paper,
   Without you there’d never be sauce to put on sausage butties,
   Without you plastic flowers in shop windows would just be plastic
   flowers in shop windows,
   Without you I’d spend my summers picking morosely over the remains of
   train crashes,
   Without you white birds would wrench themselves free from my paintings
   and fly off dripping blood into the night,
   Without you green apples wouldn’t taste greener,
   Without you Mothers wouldn’t let their children play out after tea,
   Without you every musician in the world would forget how to play the
   blues,
   Without you Public Houses would be public again,
   Without you the Sunday Times colour supplement would come out in
   black-and-white,
   Without you indifferent colonels would shrug their shoulders and press
   the button,
   Without you they’d stop changing the flowers in Piccadilly Gardens,
   Without you Clark Kent would forget how to become Superman,
   Without you Sunshine Breakfast would only consist of Cornflakes,
   Without you there’d be no colour in Magic colouring books,
   Without you Mahler’s 8th would only be performed by street musicians in
   derelict houses,
   Without you they’d forget to put the salt in every packet of crisps,
   Without you it would be an offence punishable by a fine of up to £200
   or two months’ imprisonment to be found in possession of curry powder,
   Without you riot police are massing in quiet sidestreets,
   Without you all streets would be one-way the other way,
   Without you there’d be no one not to kiss goodnight when we quarrel,
   Without you the first martian to land would turn round and go away
   again,
   Without you they’d forget to change the weather,
   Without you blind men would sell unlucky heather,
   Without you there would be
   no landscapes/ no stations/ no houses,
   no chipshops/ no quiet villages/ no seagulls
   on beaches/ no hopscotch on pavements/ no night/ no morning/ there’d be
   no city no country
   Without you.
