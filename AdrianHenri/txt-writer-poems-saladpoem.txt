   Salad Poem
   (for Henri Rousseau le Douanier)


   The sun is shining outside
   Henri Rousseau (Gentil Rousseau)
   The sky is blue
   like your skies
   I want to paint the salad
   on the table
   bright crisp green red purple
   lettuce and radishes, ham and tomatoes
   Paint them like your jungles
   Gentle Rousseau
   I want to paint
   All things bright and beautiful
   All salads great and small
   I want to make
   Blue skies bluer
   Green grass greener
   Pink flowers brighter
   Like you
   Henri Rousseau.
