   The New, Fast, Automatic Daffodils
   (New variation on Wordsworth's "Daffodils")


   I wandered lonely as
   THE NEW, FAST DAFFODIL
   INDENT-FULLY AUTOMATIC
   that floats on high o'er vales and hills
   The Daffodil is generously dimensioned to accommodate four adult
   passengers
   10,000 saw I at a glance
   Nodding their new anatomically shaped heads in sprightly dance
   Beside the lake beneath the trees
   INDENT-in three bright modern colours
   red, blue and pigskin
   The Daffodil de luxe is equipped with a host of useful accessories
   including windscreen wiper and washer with joint control
   A Daffodil doubles the enjoyment of touring at home or abroad

   in vacant or in penseive mood
