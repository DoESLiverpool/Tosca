                          A Poem Instead of a Postcard


   Dear Janine,

   A postcard from the edge
   of Africa. Impressions d'Afrique.
   Only a week, and already memories
   come and go, regular as the ferry,
   regular as thoughts of her, despite
   the catwalk grace of girls on the beach,
   each with an invisible load on her head;
   skin so black that it refracts the light,
   as evening sprawls across the harbour,
   staining dark red walls a darker red.
   I sit on the terrace for hours. The fish
   is delicious. Can't wait to paint
   the flowers. I want to stay.

   love,
   A.
