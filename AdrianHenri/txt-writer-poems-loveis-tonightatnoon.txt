   Tonight at Noon *
   (for Charles Mingus and the Clayton Squares)

   Tonight at noon
   Supermarkets will advertise 3d EXTRA on everything
   Tonight at noon
   Children from happy families will be sent to live in a home
   Elephants will tell each other human jokes
   America will declare peace on Russia
   World War I generals will sell poppies in the streets on November 11th
   The first daffodils of autumn will appear
   When the leaves fall upwards to the trees

   Tonight at noon
   Pigeons will hunt cats through city backyards
   Hitler will tell us to fight on the beaches and on the landing fields
   A tunnel full of water will be built under Liverpool
   Pigs will be sighted flying in formation over Woolton
   and Nelson will not only get his eye back but his arm as well
   White Americans will demonstrate for equal rights
   in front of the Black House
   And the Monster has just created Dr Frankenstein

   Girls in bikinis are moonbathing
   Folksongs are being sung by real folk
   Art galleries are closed to people over 21
   Poets get their poems in the Top 20
   Politicians are elected to insane asylums
   Thereâ€™s jobs for everyone and nobody wants them
   In back alleys everywhere teenage lovers are kissing
   in broad daylight

   In forgotten graveyards the dead will quietly bury the living
   and
   You will tell me you love me
   Tonight at noon.
