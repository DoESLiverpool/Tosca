   Death of a Bird in the City
   (for Philip Jones Griffiths and his photographs)


   Guns are bombarding Piccadilly
   Firing at ten million splattered white dying birds

   Doors thrown open
   Girls mouths screaming
   The last unbearable white bird
   Spotlit, slowly struggling threshing against blackness
   Crucified on the easel
   SCHWEPPES
   GUINNESS IS ...
   The lights are going out ...
   A blind old woman with light running from her glasses
   Seeing nothing.
   The plaster Christ has got up and is kneeling before the plaster donkey

   Buildings are falling silently
   Neonsigns are running like blood
   The COCA-COLA sun is setting
   The plaster Mary following the star
   B.P.          MAXFACTOR
   To where the Three Kings lay
   The last bird has leapt weeping
   Onto the neon wheel
   Delicious
   REFRESHING
   Screaming through the echoing ruins of Piccadilly
   Under the bombardment of the night.
