                              Landscape, Umfolozi
             (For the National Association of Painters in Acrylic)


   6 a.m. Mist brushed wet-on-wet
   into pale cobalt sky, monestial distance.
   A touch more medium. Foreground
   oxide of chromium, splattered sap green,
   in between a zebra's stripes, carefully redrawn,
   off-white against brown-black. At the back
   a chatter of baboons burnt umber into the branches;
   a lone hyena skulks into sage-green.
   In the foreground, quick dabs, the shy eyes
   of impala. Catch them quick
   before they dry. Through the thorn trees
   black bulk of a rhino threatens the stretchers,
   the composition. Brushes washed
   at the waterhole. The image fades
   in the eight o'clock haze
