   New York City Blues
   (for John Lennon)


   You do not cross the road
   To step into immortality
   An empty street is only the beginning

   The words will still flow through you
   Even on this cold pavement,
   Are heard in some far place
   Remote from flowers or flash-bulbs.

   In that city, on Gothic railings
   Dark against the snowy park
   Still a dead flower, a faded letter,
   Already one month old.

   "Life is what happens to you
   When you're busy making other plans,"
   This empty street
   Is only the beginning.

   Here, in your other city,
   Riot vans prowl the December dark,
   Remember angry embers of summer,
   Familiar ghost guitars echo from stucco terraces.

   Meanwhile, in the Valley of Indecision,
   We rehearse stale words, store up expected songs,
   Celebrate sad anniversaries.
   Flowers and flash-bulbs. Cold pavements.


   You do not cross the road
   To step into immortality
   At the dark end of the street
   Waits the inevitable stranger.
