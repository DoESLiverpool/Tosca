The Entry of Christ into Liverpool


   City morning. dandelionseeds     blowing from wasteground.
   smell of overgrown privethedges. children's voices
   in the distance. sounds from the river.
   round the corner into Myrtle St. Saturdaymorning shoppers
   headscarves. shoppingbaskets. dogs.

   then
   down the hill

                            THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS
                    cheering and shouting in the distance
                              children running
                                icecream vans
                      flags breaking out over buildings
                       black and red green and yellow
                        Union Jacks      Red Ensigns
                             LONG LIVE SOCIALISM
                       stretched against the blue sky
                            over St George's hall

   Now the procession

                             THE MARCHING DRUMS

          hideous masked Breughel faces of old ladies in the crowd
              yellow masks of girls in curlers and headscarves
                            smelling of factories
                          Masks     Masks     Masks
                  red masks     purple masks     pink masks

                     crushing surging carrying me along
           down the hill past the Philharmonic The Labour Exchange
          excited feet crushing the geraniums in St Luke's Gardens
                     placards      banners      posters
                             Keep Britain White
                           End the War in Vietnam
                             God Bless Our Pope

                 Billboards hoardings drawings on pavements
                          words painted on the road
                                STOP GO HALT
                the sounds of pipes and drums down the street
           little girls in yellow and orange dresses paper flowers
                             embroidered banners
                  Loyal Sons of King William Lodge, Bootle
                   Masks more Masks crowding in off buses
                      standing on walls climbing fences

                       familiar faces among the crowd
            faces of my friends the shades of Pierre Bonnard and
                            Guillaume Apollinaire
           Jarry cycling carefully through the crowd. A black cat
                          picking her way underfoot
                                   posters
                                    signs
                               gleaming salads
                              COLMAN'S MUSTARD
                       J. Ensor, Fabriqueur de Masques
                        HAIL JESUS, KING OF THE JEWS
           straining forward to catch a glimpse through the crowd,

                  white bird dying unnoticed in a corner s
                             plattered feathers
                   blood running merged with the neonsigns
                                 in a puddle
                          GUINNESS      IS     GOOD

                  brassbands cheering loudspeakers blaring
                          clatter of police horses
                        ALL POWER TO THE CONSTITUENT
                                  ASSEMBLY
                       masks cheering glittering teeth
                         daffodils trodden underfoot

                            BUTCHERS OF JERUSALEM
                banners cheering drunks stumbling and singing
                                    masks
                                    masks
                                    masks

   evening
   thin sickle moon
   pale blue sky
   flecked with bright orange clouds
   streamers newspapers discarded paper hats
   blown slowly back up the hill by the evening wind dustmen with big
   brooms sweeping the gutters
   last of the crowds waiting at bus-stops
   giggling schoolgirls quiet businessmen
   me
   walking home
   empty chip-papers drifting round my feet.
