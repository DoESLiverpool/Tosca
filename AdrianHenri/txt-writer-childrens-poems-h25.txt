   H 25


   Hedgehogs hog the hedges,
   roadhogs hog the roads:
   Iâ€™d like to build a motorway
   for badgers, frogs and toads,
   with halts for hungry hedgehogs
   at an all-night service station;
   four lanes wide and free from man
   right across the nation.
   Free from oil and petrol fumes,
   and free from motor cars,
   to see the busy hedgehogs trot
   underneath the stars.
