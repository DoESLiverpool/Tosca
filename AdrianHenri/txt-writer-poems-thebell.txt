                                    The Bell

                                    The bell
                              tolled all afternoon
                             we did not send to ask
                                   for whom.
                               It told of flowers
                             heaped in a goalmouth,
                              red and blue scarves
                          heaped together at an altar;
                                   it told of
                             eyes like T.V. screens
                        haunted by last night's images,
                         tears dried by the April wind.
                           As the flags at half-mast
                                stirred overhead
                                 the deep bell
                           still tolled in our heads
                         long after the light had gone.
