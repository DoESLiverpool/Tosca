BEGIN NOW [7]About
BEGIN NOW    Imagine you’ve been shot into space. You’re going to be counting the
BEGIN NOW    years on your fingers. To fill up some of your time, between the
BEGIN NOW    science and flying, what would you take – music or books? Or would you
BEGIN NOW    have to take both? There’s absolutely no doubt that we’d want to take
BEGIN NOW    them both, or rather that our very clever, never needs re-charging iPod
BEGIN NOW    would be full of both poems and tunes.
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused takes words and music – poets and musicians – and
BEGIN NOW    mixes them up to create gorgeous lyrical feasts for music lovers and
BEGIN NOW    secret wordsmiths alike. It’s not necessarily clever, but it is a whole
BEGIN NOW    lot of fun…
BEGIN NOW    Since 2004 we’ve been exploring our hunch that music fans can be
BEGIN NOW    encouraged to attend more live literature events, under the banner
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused. With 3 successful national tours, one of events and
BEGIN NOW    a regular presence on the festival circuit already under our belts,
BEGIN NOW    we’ve learned a lot along the way about who comes and why and about how
BEGIN NOW    music promoters are interested in getting more involved in live
BEGIN NOW    literature.
BEGIN NOW    You can find out more on the [8]events and [9]research pages.
BEGIN NOW    Until 2010, P&C was a project within the ‘stable’ of the hub, an arts
BEGIN NOW    development practice which combines research, consultancy and training
BEGIN NOW    with work as a creative producer (see [10]www.thehubuk.com). In late
BEGIN NOW    2010, we decided that the time had come for us to take the stabilisers
BEGIN NOW    off the P&C bike, and to go it alone, and so we established Phrased &
BEGIN NOW    Confused as an independent organisation. This decision reflected the
BEGIN NOW    track record we’d established since 2004, and also the growing ambition
BEGIN NOW    of our programme, along with our desire to develop year-round
BEGIN NOW    professional development support for promoters around the country, and
BEGIN NOW    – finally – the scale of the opportunity presented by the Phrased &
BEGIN NOW    Confused TV digital platform. You can find out more about this on our
BEGIN NOW    [11]professional development and [12]research pages.
BEGIN NOW    The architecture of the imagination
BEGIN NOW    Adrian-Henri1
BEGIN NOW    How to be ambitious and bold without being gimmicky?
BEGIN NOW    How to capture the chaotic ‘happening’ spirit of [11]Adrian Henri while
BEGIN NOW    saying something coherent?
BEGIN NOW    How to spark off the Mersey poets’ work without writing something
BEGIN NOW    hackneyed?
BEGIN NOW    These are the exciting maddening challenges I’ve been exploring so far
BEGIN NOW    in the development of Liverpool I love your horny handed tons of soil,
BEGIN NOW    a collaborative performance bringing together spoken word, live music
BEGIN NOW    and digital art forms. The title is taken from a fragment poem by
BEGIN NOW    Adrian Henri and captures the passion, energy and sense of longing that
BEGIN NOW    I want to put on stage when we perform 15 mins from the piece at the
BEGIN NOW    [12]Liverpool Philharmonic Music Rooms on March 18th. The piece will
BEGIN NOW    look at what’s been lost and found in the re-sculpting of the Liverpool
BEGIN NOW    landscape in the past fifty years, exploring the layering of past
BEGIN NOW    present and imagination when we look at the buildings around us. I came
BEGIN NOW    across this quotation from Adrian Henri last week and it reassured me
BEGIN NOW    that we’re on the right track with our thematic ideas:
BEGIN NOW    ‘The architecture which springs most directly from the imagination, and
BEGIN NOW    which appeals most directly to it, belongs in one way or another to
BEGIN NOW    naïve or primitive consciousness. It is not conceived as a finished
BEGIN NOW    work, but grows; it works by extension, addition, subtraction.’
BEGIN NOW    And maybe that’s the way we’re going to put our piece together too:
BEGIN NOW    bringing together seemingly disparate parts, allowing something to grow
BEGIN NOW    uninhibited, following our instincts. While I’m working with long time
BEGIN NOW    musical collaborators  Vidar Norheim and Martin Heslop, I’m also being
BEGIN NOW    pushed way out of my comfort zone through conversations with digital
BEGIN NOW    makers at [13]DOES Liverpool led by Adrian McEwen, a man capable of
BEGIN NOW    connecting almost anything to the internet (see his ‘internet of
BEGIN NOW    things’ project). If there’s a way to connect poetry to digital
BEGIN NOW    robotics then I promise we’ll find it.
BEGIN NOW    I’ve also been talking psycho-geography with Jonathan Sharma of [14]K2
BEGIN NOW    architects who showed me architectural images, describing the way
BEGIN NOW    they’re built up through layering (what was there, what will be there,
BEGIN NOW    photographs, pencil drawings etc): a pleasingly tidy metaphor for our
BEGIN NOW    layering of feeling and perspective in relation to the streets we live
BEGIN NOW    in.
BEGIN NOW    Just to make the mix of ideas richer, on March 5rd Vidar and I will
BEGIN NOW    join visual artists Louise Flooks and Holly * for a session with
BEGIN NOW    [15]Unity Theatre’s [16]Splatterdays kids group, uncovering how the
BEGIN NOW    city looks through a child’s eyes and how it might be re-imagined
BEGIN NOW    through play. They’ll be building 3-D models of landscapes and houses,
BEGIN NOW    drawing their ideal Liverpool. I want to know how free they feel in the
BEGIN NOW    Liverpool, whether they have enough space, whether they believe they
BEGIN NOW    can have adventures and where those adventures could take them.
BEGIN NOW    So with just three weeks to solve this brilliant muddle, I’m
BEGIN NOW    channelling the anarchic spirit of Adrian Henri and trusting that out
BEGIN NOW    of this collision of the primitive and the high-tech, of poetry and
BEGIN NOW    code, of old and new Liverpool, something whole and beautiful will
BEGIN NOW    spring.
BEGIN NOW [6]Research
BEGIN NOW    At Phrased & Confused, we’re unashamedly proud of our data geek
BEGIN NOW    anoraks. However, our geekiness is offset by a strong belief that
BEGIN NOW    research is a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. When we
BEGIN NOW    set out to do some research it’s because we want to know the answer to
BEGIN NOW    some questions that are bugging us, or because we want to get inside a
BEGIN NOW    particular issue, or know more about our audiences. We want to know all
BEGIN NOW    this because it helps us to measure what we’re doing, and to plan what
BEGIN NOW    we might do in the future.
BEGIN NOW    When we’re not working on bringing great music and spoken word to you,
BEGIN NOW    some of us spend our time crunching those numbers and chewing the
BEGIN NOW    spoken word cud. Over the years we’ve done various pieces of research.
BEGIN NOW    Here’s a summary of some of them…
BEGIN NOW    Audience Research
BEGIN NOW    We’re big on audience research. We have to be, because our aim with
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused is to attract new people to spoken word, and we need
BEGIN NOW    to know if all our hard efforts are doing that. So, we try to come up
BEGIN NOW    with lateral thinking ways of getting you guys to tell us more about
BEGIN NOW    you and what you think of us. It’s our way of getting us introduced to
BEGIN NOW    each other.
BEGIN NOW    Here are some of the things you’ve told us at [7]Summer Sundae in 2009…
BEGIN NOW    • 51% of you were aged 25 or under
BEGIN NOW    • 91% of you had been to more than 3 music gigs in the previous 12
BEGIN NOW    months, and 42% to more than 10
BEGIN NOW    • Meanwhile, 57% of you said you’d been to ‘1 or 2’ spoken word events
BEGIN NOW    in the same period – but anecdotal feedback suggests that this may well
BEGIN NOW    have been at our own P&C tent or fringe gig.
BEGIN NOW    • Only 19% of you had been to a spoken word tent at another festival,
BEGIN NOW    suggesting that Phrased & Confused reaches audiences other spoken word
BEGIN NOW    brands can’t!
BEGIN NOW    • 64% of you said that having checked out Phrased & Confused you
BEGIN NOW    intended to go to further spoken word events in the future
BEGIN NOW    • 64% of you had listened to artist tracks on the Phrased & Confused
BEGIN NOW    USB wristband you picked up at the festival
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused TV – Feasibility Research
BEGIN NOW    In 2009 we secured Arts Council England support for a research project
BEGIN NOW    to “explore the potential for a bespoke digital platform for spoken
BEGIN NOW    word, which would harness the audience development potential of digital
BEGIN NOW    technology, enable UK-based artists to develop relationships with
BEGIN NOW    global consumers, able to ‘mainline’ their live literature on demand,
BEGIN NOW    via their PCs, MP3 players or mobile phones”. Later that year, we
BEGIN NOW    collected feedback from our festival audiences, and in the first half
BEGIN NOW    of 2010 we turned our attention to those working in the sector. We used
BEGIN NOW    this feedback to help us model how a digital platform (provisionally
BEGIN NOW    called Phrased & Confused TV) might best be delivered, scoping out the
BEGIN NOW    platform’s functionality, testing and spec-ing out the most appropriate
BEGIN NOW    ‘front’ and back end’ models for the platform and exploring income
BEGIN NOW    generation opportunities. We then moved onto drill down in more detail
BEGIN NOW    into: vision and aims; the offer to artists, arts organisations and
BEGIN NOW    audiences; the platform model; skills development programme; content;
BEGIN NOW    evaluation, audience and user research and benchmarking; marketing; HR;
BEGIN NOW    timetable, and financial projections.
BEGIN NOW    All this work means that we’re confident that we’ve got the P&C TV
BEGIN NOW    ‘offer’ right. We’ve ‘walked through’ the project to put together a
BEGIN NOW    detailed operational structure and job descriptions, budget and
BEGIN NOW    timeline. So far, so feasible. Turning to the figures, our research
BEGIN NOW    into the potential to generate earned income potential confirmed that,
BEGIN NOW    at present, it’s pretty nigh impossible for niche platforms such as
BEGIN NOW    this to do this to any real extent. It’s a tough time to be fundraising
BEGIN NOW    and the biggest question mark is over financial viability. Our
BEGIN NOW    fundraising research points to a number of possibilities, but success
BEGIN NOW    here – and the feasibility of the project – will depend on: potential
BEGIN NOW    funders’ willingness and ability to join us in testing our proposition.
BEGIN NOW    We’re actively working on all of this now, so join our mailing list to
BEGIN NOW    stay up to date with developments.
BEGIN NOW [7]Skills Development
BEGIN NOW    As well as being creative producers, the Phrased & Confused team also
BEGIN NOW    has a strong track record for its training, mentoring and broader
BEGIN NOW    professional development programmes. Since 2006, we’ve been running
BEGIN NOW    specific projects for spoken word artists, promoters and producers,
BEGIN NOW    including a unique commissioning scheme that helps artists to create
BEGIN NOW    new work, and a training programme that helps emerging promoters to
BEGIN NOW    develop their business-related skills. It’s work that we really believe
BEGIN NOW    in, not only because of its value to those we support and the impact it
BEGIN NOW    has on the wider scene, but also because it enables us to share what
BEGIN NOW    we’ve learnt and – selfishly – it helps us to get better at what we do
BEGIN NOW    too!
BEGIN NOW    Phrased & Confused artist commissions
BEGIN NOW    We’ve been commissioning artists since 2008 to create new work that
BEGIN NOW    explores the meeting place between music and spoken word, and in that
BEGIN NOW    time have supported more than 20 artists and musicians to develop their
BEGIN NOW    stage craft, performance and presentation. [8]Find out more…
BEGIN NOW    “It was a really supportive process with Phrased and Confused. It’s
BEGIN NOW    been a really, really amazing experience where we’ve been able to
BEGIN NOW    concentrate on being performers.” – Sifundo Msebele
BEGIN NOW    Developing artists via our tours
BEGIN NOW    When we go out on the road, it’s not enough for our artists to simply
BEGIN NOW    do what they normally do. We work with artists who are up for something
BEGIN NOW    new, and help them to develop new material together, either from
BEGIN NOW    scratch or by improvising on existing poems or songs they bring to the
BEGIN NOW    table. [9]Find out more…
BEGIN NOW    Supporting promoters around the country
BEGIN NOW    Our experience tells us that it’s promoters and producers who are just
BEGIN NOW    as key to a healthy touring circuit as artists – in what ever art form.
BEGIN NOW    So, we’re currently building on work we’ve previously done to support
BEGIN NOW    the development of promoters and producers around the country and
BEGIN NOW    undertaking a new piece of research to see what will most benefit the
BEGIN NOW    national scene in terms of a professional development programme for
BEGIN NOW    spoken word producers.
