   Robocat


   Our new cat’s a robot
   He really is a sight
   No need to feed him Whiskas
   We just plug him in at night

   Faster than a speeding arrow
   He beats the mice to every hole
   Nothing’s safe from Supercat
   Pigeon, rat or vole

   Our new cat’s bionic
   His miaow can shatter glass
   He dug up next door’s gardent
   Then started on someone’s path

   The neighbours didn’t like him
   So they looked in the catalogue
   Clubbed together and ordered
   A bionic Superdog

   Now Rex is king of the Crescent
   Poor Tom won’t leave the house
   Won’t even play with his video game
   He’s afraid to touch the mouse

   Curled up next to his socket
   With a soft, electric purr
   Robocat’s a pussycat
   When Robodog is there.
