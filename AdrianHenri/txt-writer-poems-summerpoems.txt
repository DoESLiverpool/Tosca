   1          Try to imagine your next hangover

   2          Travel on the Woodside ferry with your eyes closed. Travel
   back with them open.

   3          Look for a black cat. Stoke it. This will be either lucky or
   unlucky.

   4          Find a plastic flower. Hold it up to the light.

   5          Next time you see someone mowing a lawn smell the smell of
   freshly cut grass.

   6          Watch Coronation Street. Listen to the ‘B’’ side of the
   latest Dusty Springfield record.

   7          Sit in a city square in the sunlight. Remember the first
   time you made love.

   8          Look at every poster you pass next time you’re on a bus.

   9          The next time you clean your teeth think about what you’re
   doing.
