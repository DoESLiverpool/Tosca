   Claustrophobia


   Emily’s got claustrophobia
   She’s afraid of Santa Claus
   Christmas is different in her house
   It’s not like in mine or yours

   She’s terrified of men with beards
   And suits of brightest red
   Sneaking down the chimney
   While she’s fast asleep in bed

   She’s hidden away her stockings
   At the back of the chest of drawers
   She’s covered up the fireplace
   And locked the bedroom door

   A kiss from Father Christmas
   Is the thing she dreads the most
   She’d rather be hugged by Dracula
   Or Jacob Marley’s ghost

   She hates holly, robins and ivy
   She won’t go and play in the snow
   You’ll never catch her standing
   Beneath the mistletoe

   Emily’s got claustrophobia
   Carol singers make her feel queer
   Don’t wish her a Merry Christmas
   She’s hiding away till New Year.
