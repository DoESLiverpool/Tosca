   Colden Valley, Early Spring


   Frost persists to afternoon
   on one side of this valley
   icicles depend
   the shadow of the other bank
   moves inexorably to the diagonal
   never allowing the daylight to fall
   here.

   Rich textures of lichen
   green elephant-hide of beeches
   palest sienna of bracken
   beckon in the March sunlight.

   Here there are only stones of purest marble
   frozen in small streams.
   The brightest afternoon
   cannot dispel the darkness
   beneath these stunted branches.
