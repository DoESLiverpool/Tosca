   Blues for Slim
   (in memoriam Slim Galliard)


   Cement mixer don't putty-putty no more
   Cement mixer don't putty-putty no more
   Cos my man Slim has gone to Lethe's shore

   There's silence down on 52nd Street
   Silence all down 52nd Street
   Couldn't hear the King of Vouti's beat

   Went to Laguna, watched the tide come in
   Went to Laguna, watched the tide come in
   Searched the beach but couldn't see my Slim

   No I'm dunkin' bagels back in Liverpool town
   Dunkin' bagels back in Liverpool town
   Thinking of Slim as the Mersey sun goes down

   Cement mixer don't go putty-putty no more
   Cement mixer don't go putty-putty no more
   Cos my man Slim has gone to Lethe's shore
