   The Haunted Disco


   When it’s half past three in the morning
   right through to break of day,
   a phantom DJ opens up
   for the dead to come and play.

   The coloured lights are flashing,
   and the crowd are on their feet,
   but there’s no sound of them dancing
   to the ghostly disco-beat.

   When there’s ice between your shoulders,
   and the hairs rise on your neck,
   and you don’t know who you’re dancing with
   at the haunted discotheque.

   When you daren’t look at your partner,
   and you fear their bony hand,
   the go-go ghosts all boogie
   to an ancient, nameless band.

   The graveyard sounds are all around
   the mist drifts everywhere,
   but the ghastly crowds in mini-shrouds
   rave on without a care.

   When there’s ice between your shoulders,
   and the hairs rise on your neck,
   and you know you’ll dance for ever
   in the haunted discotheque.
