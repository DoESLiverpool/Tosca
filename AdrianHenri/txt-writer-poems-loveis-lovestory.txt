  Love Story, Bosnia
  (i.m. Bosko Broki and Admira Ismic)


   Bosko and Admira
   huddle near in no-manâ€™s-land,
   hand almost touching hand.
   They do not move as other lovers.

   Dead cellars of Sarajevo.
   Birds beat on the empty wind
   Playground silence broken
   by the cackle of assault rifles.

   The sweater his mother knitted for her
   lies on the grave her mother cannot visit.

   Helpless as words,
   their few flowers wilt in the indifferent sun.
