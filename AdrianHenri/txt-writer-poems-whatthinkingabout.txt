   What Were You Thinking About ?


   Dressed and then dressed again
   what were you thinking about
   undressed

   I left my mink in the hallway
   and we went into the desert
   We lived on love and cold water
   we loved each other in our poverty
   we even ate our dirty linen in public
   and on the black sand tablecloth
   the sunlight spread its golden dishes
   We loved each other in our poverty
   we lived on love and cold water
   my body your freehold property.


                           Translated from Jacques Pr√©vert
