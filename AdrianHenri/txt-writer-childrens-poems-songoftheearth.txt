   Song of the Earth


   Look deep into the hidden world of ponds.
   Mosses, tadpoles, the gently-moving fronds
   of water-crowfoot. Help clean up
   this tiny world. Curled tendrils of fern
   peer hopefully through bin-bags, chip-papers,
   choke on polystyrene. Green water
   fights for its breath amid the stink fo sewage,
   black rainbows of oil. Mersey and Alt,
   Dee and Weaver leave a cry for help
   with every tide. Our leavings mark
   their riverside.

   So bring in your wellies, bring in your macs,
   never mind sore feet or aching backs.

   Take a dawn walk on Hilbre. Wait
   in the silvery light to see the birds migrate.
   Clean up the Lowfields, clean up the beach,
   clear the canal and footpath, each of you
   can find a small thing to do
   to reciprocate. Give back the gifts
   of scabious and celandine, wood anemone
   and wild garlic, before itâ€™s too late.

   So bring binoculars, notebook and pen,
   this land can be green and pleasant again.

   Families lark in the mud to trace the tiny creatures.
   A pond made safe for toad. Behind the motorways,
   the access-roads, the land shyly reveals its features.
   In Kirby a wood grows where one nearly died;
   look inside: see how new life starts
   beneath tyres and tin cans, boxes and shopping-carts.

   So bring your raincoats, bring your boots,
   dig in the earth and find your roots.

   Life is short but the earth is long
   put your ear to the ground and hear its song.
