                                Garden, Giverny



                          Delphiniums, sweet williams,
                                purple gladioli,
                       against yellow asters, marigolds,
                            the whirl of sunflowers;
                 glimpsed pink walls against emerald shutters.

                                 A bamboo-grove
                     lurks in the shadows by the lily-pond,
                              patient as a tiger.
                        Lovers kiss on a Japanese bridge
                         watched by the bearded phantom
                            from behind the willows,
                    sad as a blind girl in a summer garden.
