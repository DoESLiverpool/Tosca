BEGIN NOW    we loved each other in our povertyEND
BEGIN NOW    we even ate our dirty linen in publicEND
BEGIN NOW    and on the black sand tableclothEND
BEGIN NOW    the sunlight spread its golden dishesEND
BEGIN NOW    We loved each other in our povertyEND
BEGIN NOW    we lived on love and cold waterEND
BEGIN NOW    my body your freehold property.END
