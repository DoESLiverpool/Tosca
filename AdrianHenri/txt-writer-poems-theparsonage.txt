   The Parsonage, Haworth

   In the earth, the earth thou shalt be laid,
   A grey stone standing over thee;
   Black mould beneath thee spread,
   And black mould to cover thee.
   Emily BrontÃ«


   Gravestones piled deep as fallen leaves,
   trodden into the sodden ground;
   last consumptive flush of Autumn
   in the sycamores;
   a kissing-gate swings disused
   in the bitter wind.

   Cries of crows, rattle of rain,
   on the nursery windowpane;
   insistent tick of the grandfather clock,
   insistent tock of the stonemason's hammer,
   stammered epitaphs
   swathed in lichened green.

   It is not the stone that eats their bodies,
   but the black spring that runs through them
   that feeds the dark sarcophagus.

   A glimpse of sun
   sudden as a blush suffusing soft cheeks;
   pale blue eyes
   calling through blonde coppices of hair
   across the dimpled moors.
