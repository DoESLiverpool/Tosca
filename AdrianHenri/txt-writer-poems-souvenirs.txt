   Souvenirs
   (for John and Anne Willett)


   Chocolate sardines, torn election-posters MAR
   CHAIS, huddled sheep before a distant sepia
   view of Pourville. The yellow-and-grey world
   of Lords and Ladies on the wallpaper in
   the lingerie. Lemon light. Night hydrangeas.
   The smell of the ferry, scrubbed mussels
   deep blue in a white bowl in the electric kitchen,
   where moths beat against the windowpane. Blinding
   rain that wipes away the cliffs at Etretat.

   Green depths of evening sous-bois, tall trees
   that shutter the light along the banks outside
   the villages. A black workman's suit, a sailor's cap
   bought beside St Jacques. Oeufs de Pâques.
   Andouillettes, and mackerel cooked with driftwood
   on the beach. Each stone that I've brought home
   since 1968. Late light across the harvestfields
   from Ambrumesnil. Cattle dream, creamy as caramel.
   The smell across the valley from the Nescafé factory.

   The tall gingko tree that split ten years ago,
   one twin trunk that still lies overgrown,
   immutable as memory.
