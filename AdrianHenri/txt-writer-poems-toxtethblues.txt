   Adrian Henri's Talking Toxteth Blues


   Well, I woke up this morning, there was buzzing overhead
   Saw the helicopter as I got out of my bed,
   Smelt the smell of burning, saw the buildings fall,
   Bulldozers pulling down next door's wall.
   Toxteth nightmare …
   … yes …
   … city with a hangover.

   Then I remembered what happened last night
   The sirens and the shouting and the TV lights,
   Banging on the riotshields, petrol bombs in flames,
   Cars all ablazing, shattered window-frames.
   Felt sick to my stomach …
   … don't cry for me …
   … Upper Parly.

   Saw a busy lying blood pouring from his head,
   Saw one stop a paving stone, thought that he was dead.
   Heard the sound of engines in the bright orange night,
   Saw the headlights blazing, saw the crowd in flight.
   One of them …
   … didn't run fast enough …
   … Land Rovers …
   … long way from the farm.

   Well, I saw the Chief Constable up on TV
   And the Superintendents, but they never saw me,
   Saw the Home Secretary and the Minister for Riots,
   And all them social workers who just never keep quiet.
   … never met a one of them …
   … neither did the coppers.

   Saw a woman walking in the firelight's glare,
   "Hey, Aunty Maggy, what you doing there?"
   Arms full of liquor and a portable TV,
   Said, "All the rest are doing it, why not me?
   … do yourself a favour, son,
   … nice music centre …
   … over there.’’

   Well, I thought a bit about it and I took her advice
   Crowd was having fun and the goods looked nice,
   Then a scuffer copped me and they threw me in a van,
   Took me off to Risley and the Magistrate Man.
   … exemplary sentence …
   … act as a deterrent …
   … law 'n' order …
   … Toxteth nightmare ….
   … city …
   … with a
   hangover.
