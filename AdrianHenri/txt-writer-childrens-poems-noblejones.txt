      Noble Jones from Wallasey, the bravest cat in the world

      Noble Jones is noble
      Noble Jones is strong
      Noble Jones goes round the place
      Defending right from wrong
      A smile upon his noble face
      Embodiment of feline grace
      He’s the pride of Merseyside
      The bravest cat in the world.

   A gang of desperadoes
   Had terrorized the land
   There were ugly scenes in Milton Keynes
   Till Noble took a hand

   He hounded them in Hounslow
   And tied some up in Tring
   He caught the rest in Crawley
   They couldn’t do a thing

   Single-pawed he beat them
   At their evil game
   Locked them up in Wormwood Scrubs
   And wouldn’t leave his name.

      For Noble Jones is modest
      And Noble Jones is strong
      Villains quake and start to shake
      When Noble comes along.

   Relaxing at New Brighton
   Curled up on the beach
   He saw a kitten drowning
   Swept from her parent’s reach

   Swiftly to the rescue
   He sprang into the waves
   Avoiding by a whisker
   A hero’s watery grave

   Safely from the Mersey
   He set her on the shore
   But when the crowd turned round to cheer
   He’d disappeared once more.

      For Noble Jones is modest
      And Noble Jones is shy
      People cheer, forget their fear
      When Noble passes by.

   One day at Watford Junction
   The brakes refused to function
   And the Inter-City nearly left the track

   With no fear of broken bones
   Down jumped brave Noble Jones
   Dug in his claws and hauled the engine back.

      As big as a crocodile’s toothbrush
      As huge as a dinosaur’s bones
      As large as an elephant’s hanky
      Is the heart of Noble Jones.
      In Cardiff and Camarthen
      They sang his praise aloud
      From Penrith down to Plymouth
      The did our hero proud

   When The Queen conferred his Knighthood
   A banner was unfurled
   SIR NOBLE JONES FROM WALLASEY
   THE BRAVEST CAT IN THE WORLD.

      For Noble Jones is noble
      And Noble Jones is strong
      Noble Jones goes round the place
      Defending right from wrong
      A smile upon his noble face
      Embodiment of feline grace
      He’s the pride of Merseyside
      The bravest cat in the world.
