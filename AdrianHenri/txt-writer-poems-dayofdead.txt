   The Day of the Dead, Hope Street


   silence in Hope Street
   silence in stony places
   after the agony in St. Luke's Gardens
   silence


   'Ladies and Gentlemen
   Senors y Senoras
   for one night only
   The Simultaneous and Historical Faces of
   Death!'


   fade in F.X. laughter
   faint boxy sound of cheap guitars
   songs torn from dried-up larynxes


   they dance
   ignoring double yellow lines
   around crimson traffic signs
   ROAD CLOSED
   noseless faces laugh elated
   clattering pasodobles
   echo from the walls of the Philharmonic Hall
   GRAN VERBENA DE CALAVERAS
   stretched across the street
   before the Cathedral's crowned nosecone
   pink   turquoise   ice blue
   sequinned skirts whirl
   faster and faster farandoles
   a lone black cat
   picks her way between the dancers
   heaped marigolds scream orange defiance


   the Consul white suit crumpled
   lounges in the doorway of the Philharmonic Pub
   tequila in hand
   bloodred tropical sunset
   reflected in his eyes


   Trauermusik:

   above the rattle of firecrackers
   raucous chords scrawled
   by bony fingers
   above high strings
   the pure clear sound of a viola


   a tall, black-bearded Irishman
   a short-haired girl in black ski-pants
   scarlet tin-soldier jacket
   peer through the crowd
   as white elbows snap
   doff their sombreros
   dance round their hats
   skeleton senoras
   elegant in pink-and-white boas
   watch stately
   their pinstriped husbands
   tap silverheaded cans to the rhythm


   confetti hurled in the air
   hot breath
   the smell mescal   enchiladas
   pink   white   yellow
   cellophaned flowers forgotten underfoot
   a black-and-white sheepdog
   sniffs our flesh round rotting bones
   lifts its leg against traffic cones
   calaveras    calaveras    calaveras
   prance castanets click
   quicken the rhythm of the dance


   at dusk
   the carnival departs
   hands yellow with the dust of mimosa
   hair braided with crimson carnations
   a trail of bright red petals
   trodden beneath her limping feet
   echoing distant laughter
   along the empty street
