set the time and date or the compiler complains:

date --set "hh:mm mm/dd/yy"

i had to mess around setting the locale for a while, but i'm not sure what actually got it going!
if you type
locale

it will complain about not finding some files and then give a list of variables with two missing

I think typing

export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
export LANGUAGE="en_US.UTF-8"

should do it, but i also tried putting them into /etc/environment and /etc/default/locale
and ran
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

i ended up somehow changing it all to GB but it might be easier to use US as most of the varibles are already set to it
i got info from: http://askubuntu.com/questions/162391/how-do-i-fix-my-locale-issue/790373#790373
you might need to log out and in again (but if you shutdown the bb, don't forget to set the date again). It's probably a lot easier than i made it.

I think when you enter
locale
and all the variables are set its ready.
