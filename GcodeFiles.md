There's a webpage that can take SVG, process it and upload it to the BB server (if the ip number is correct)

Code for javascript front end and gcode generator that uploads to BB
http://doesliverpool.github.io/svgraph.html

The webserver thing running on BB that holds the scripts called from 
https://bitbucket.org/goatchurch/twistcodewiki

(needs to be running on the BB from the twistcodewiki directory on the ssh command line)

The scripts are in here:  https://bitbucket.org/goatchurch/twistcodewiki/src/6cf9f046090d9547d35c350e0a810298544c8436/cgipipe/?at=default

Someone could convert these two a simple flask framework or something
